Warnings and Precautions to and for some patients acute sinusitis is self limiting reserve ciprofloxacin tablets for treatment of acute sinusitis in patients who have no alternative treatment options Usage To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin tablets and other antibacterial drugs ciprofloxacin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria When culture and susceptibility information are available they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy In the absence of such data local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection appropriate therapy should be administered Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin Therapy with ciprofloxacin tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued As with other drugs some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables Dosage in Adults The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection the susceptibility of the causative microorganism the integrity of the patient s host defense mechanisms and the status of renal and hepatic function Ciprofloxacin tablets may be administered to adult patients when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician Table Adult Dosage Guidelines Generally ciprofloxacin should be continued for at least days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared except for inhalational anthrax post exposure Used in conjunction with metronidazole Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure Infection Dose Frequency Usual Durations Skin and Skin Structure to mg every hours to days Bone and Joint to mg every hours to weeks Complicated Intra Abdominal mg every hours to days Infectious Diarrhea mg every hours to days Typhoid Fever mg every hours days Uncomplicated Urethral and Cervical

mg intravenous every hours mg Tablet every hours mg intravenous every hours Dosage in Pediatric Patients Dosing and initial route of therapy that is IV or oral for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered as described in Table Table Pediatric Dosage Guidelines The total duration of therapy for cUTI and pyelonephritis in the clinical trial was determined by the physician The mean duration of treatment was days range to days Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Y pestis Infection Dose Frequency Total Duration Complicated Urinary Tract or Pyelonephritis patients from to years of age mg kg to mg kg maximum mg per dose not to be exceeded even in patients weighing more than kg Every hours to days Inhalational Anthrax Post Exposure mg kg maximum mg per dose Every hours days Plague mg kg maximum mg per dose Every to hours days Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion however the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment Nonetheless some modification of dosage is recommended particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table Table Recommended Starting and Maintenance Doses for Adult Patients with Impaired Renal Function Creatinine Clearance mL min Dose See Usual Dosage to to mg every hours to to mg every hours Patients on hemodialysis or Peritoneal dialysis to mg every hours after dialysis When only the serum creatinine concentration is known the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance Men Creatinine clearance mL min Weight kg x age x serum creatinine mg dL Women x the value calculated for men The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment a unit dose of mg may be administered at the intervals noted above Patients should be carefully monitored Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency that is creatinine clearance of mL min m Important Administration Instructions With Multivalent Cations Administer ciprofloxacin tablets at least hours before or

who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages see Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon and has also been reported with the rotator cuff the shoulder the hand the biceps the thumb and other tendons Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally The risk of developing fluoroquinolone associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over years of age in patients taking corticosteroid drugs and in patients with kidney heart or lung transplants Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity renal failure and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain swelling inflammation or rupture of a tendon Avoid fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture see Adverse Reactions Peripheral Neuropathy Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and or large axons resulting in paresthesias hypoesthesias dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of ciprofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients see Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain burning tingling numbness and or weakness or other alterations in sensations including light touch pain temperature position sense and vibratory sensation and or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition Avoid fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy see Adverse Reactions Central Nervous System Effects Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions including toxic psychosis psychotic reactions progressing to suicidal ideations thoughts hallucinations or paranoia depression or self injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide anxiety agitation or nervousness confusion delirium disorientation or disturbances in attention insomnia or nightmares memory impairment These reactions may occur following the first dose Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur discontinue the drug and institute appropriate care Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with an increased risk of seizures convulsions increased intracranial pressure pseudotumor cerebri dizziness and tremors Ciprofloxacin like other fluoroquinolones is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold Cases of status epilepticus have been reported As with all fluoroquinolones use ciprofloxacin with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold for example severe cerebral arteriosclerosis previous history of convulsion reduced cerebral blood flow altered brain structure or stroke or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold for example certain drug therapy renal dysfunction If seizures occur discontinue ciprofloxacin and institute appropriate care see Adverse Reactions and Drug Interactions Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis Postmarketing serious adverse reactions including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis see Adverse Reactions Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions some due to hypersensitivity and some due to uncertain etiology have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones including ciprofloxacin These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following Fever rash or severe dermatologic reactions for example toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens Johnson syndrome Vasculitis arthralgia myalgia serum sickness Allergic pneumonitis Interstitial nephritis acute renal insufficiency or failure Hepatitis jaundice acute hepatic necrosis or failure Anemia including hemolytic and aplastic thrombocytopenia including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura leukopenia agranulocytosis pancytopenia and or other hematologic abnormalities Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted see Adverse Reactions Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity anaphylactic reactions some following the first dose have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy including ciprofloxacin Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse loss of consciousness tingling pharyngeal or facial edema dyspnea urticaria and itching Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures including oxygen intravenous fluids intravenous antihistamines corticosteroids pressor amines and airway management including intubation as indicated see Adverse Reactions Hepatotoxicity Cases of severe hepatotoxicity including hepatic necrosis life threatening hepatic failure and fatal events have been reported with ciprofloxacin Acute liver injury is rapid in onset range to days and is often associated with hypersensitivity The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular cholestatic or mixed Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than years old In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis such as anorexia jaundice dark urine pruritus or tender abdomen discontinue treatment immediately There can be a temporary increase in transaminases alkaline phosphatase or cholestatic jaundice especially in patients with previous liver damage who are treated with ciprofloxacin see Adverse Reactions Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones particularly in elderly patients The cause for the increased risk has not been identified In patients with a known aortic aneurysm or patients who are at greater risk for aortic aneurysms reserve ciprofloxacin for use only when there are no alternative antibacterial treatments available Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Theophylline Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and theophylline These reactions have included cardiac arrest seizure status epilepticus and respiratory failure Instances of nausea vomiting tremor irritability or palpitation have also occurred Although similar serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving theophylline alone the possibility that these reactions may be potentiated by ciprofloxacin cannot be eliminated If concomitant use cannot be avoided monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate see Drug Interactions Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile C difficile associated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents including ciprofloxacin and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C difficile C difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD Hypertoxin producing isolates of C difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents If CDAD is suspected or confirmed ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C difficile may need to be discontinued Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management protein supplementation antibacterial treatment of C difficile and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated see Adverse Reactions Prolongation of the QT Interval Some fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and cases of arrhythmia Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval risk factors for QT prolongation or torsade de pointes for example congenital long QT syndrome uncorrected electrolyte imbalance such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and cardiac disease such as heart failure myocardial infarction or bradycardia and patients receiving Class IA antiarrhythmic agents quinidine procainamide or Class III antiarrhythmic agents amiodarone sotalol tricyclic antidepressants macrolides and antipsychotics Elderly patients may also be more susceptible to drug associated effects on the QT interval see Adverse Reactions Use in Specific Populations Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients less than years of age only for cUTI prevention of inhalational anthrax post exposure and plague see Indications and Usage An increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls including reactions related to joints and or surrounding tissues has been observed see Adverse Reactions In pre clinical studies oral administration of ciprofloxacin caused lameness in immature dogs Histopathological examination of the weight bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage Related quinolone class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species see Use in Specific Populations and Nonclinical Toxicology Photosensitivity Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity phototoxicity reactions the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions for example burning erythema exudation vesicles blistering edema involving areas exposed to light typically the face V area of the neck extensor surfaces of the forearms dorsa of the hands can be associated with the use of quinolones including ciprofloxacin after sun or UV light exposure Therefore avoid excessive exposure to these sources of light Discontinue ciprofloxacin if phototoxicity occurs see Adverse Reactions Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing ciprofloxacin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria Potential Risks with Concomitant Use of Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P A Enzymes Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of the hepatic CYP A enzyme pathway Co administration of ciprofloxacin and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP A for example theophylline methylxanthines caffeine tizanidine ropinirole clozapine olanzapine and zolpidem results in increased plasma concentrations of the co administered drug and could lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic adverse reactions of the co administered drug see Drug Interactions and Clinical Pharmacology Interference with Timely Diagnosis of Syphilis Ciprofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis Antimicrobial agents used in high dose for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis Perform a serologic test for syphilis in all patients with gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis Perform follow up serologic test for syphilis three months after ciprofloxacin treatment Crystalluria Crystals of ciprofloxacin have been observed rarely in the urine of human subjects but more frequently in the urine of laboratory animals which is usually alkaline see Nonclinical Toxicology Crystalluria related to ciprofloxacin has been reported only rarely in humans because human urine is usually acidic Avoid alkalinity of the urine in patients receiving ciprofloxacin Hydrate patients well to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine see Dosage and Administration Blood Glucose Disturbances Fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin have been associated with disturbances of blood glucose including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent for example glyburide or with insulin In these patients careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with ciprofloxacin discontinue ciprofloxacin and initiate appropriate therapy immediately see Adverse Reactions Drug Interactions ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise

chromatopsia and photopsia Decreased Visual Acuity Diplopia Tinnitus Hearing Loss Bad Taste In randomized double blind controlled clinical trials comparing ciprofloxacin tablets mg two times daily BID to cefuroxime axetil mg to mg BID and to clarithromycin mg BID in patients with respiratory tract infections ciprofloxacin demonstrated a CNS adverse reaction profile comparable to the control drugs Pediatric Patients Short weeks and long term year musculoskeletal and neurological safety of oral intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI or pyelonephritis in pediatric patients to years of age mean age of years in an international multicenter trial The duration of therapy was to days mean duration of treatment was days with a range of to days A total of ciprofloxacin and comparator treated patients were enrolled An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee IPSC reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse reactions including abnormal gait or abnormal joint exam baseline or treatment emergent Within weeks of treatment initiation the rates of musculoskeletal adverse reactions were in the ciprofloxacin treated group versus in comparator treated patients All musculoskeletal adverse reactions occurring by weeks resolved clinical resolution of signs and symptoms usually within days of end of treatment Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the adverse reactions Ciprofloxacin treated patients were more likely to report more than one adverse reaction and on more than one occasion compared to control patients The rate of musculoskeletal adverse reactions was consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group across all age subgroups At the end of year the rate of these adverse reactions reported at any time during that period was in the ciprofloxacin treated group versus in the comparator treated patients Table Table Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions as Assessed by the IPSC Included arthralgia abnormal gait abnormal joint exam joint sprains leg pain back pain arthrosis bone pain pain myalgia arm pain and decreased range of motion in a joint knee elbow ankle hip wrist and shoulder The study was designed to demonstrate that the arthropathy rate for the ciprofloxacin group did not exceed that of the control group by more than At both the week and year evaluations the confidence interval indicated that it could not be concluded that the ciprofloxacin group had findings comparable to the control group Ciprofloxacin Comparator All Patients within weeks Confidence Interval Age Group months months years years years years years to years All Patients within year Confidence Interval The incidence rates of neurological adverse reactions within weeks of treatment initiation were in the ciprofloxacin group versus in the comparator group and included dizziness nervousness insomnia and somnolence In this trial the overall incidence rates of adverse reactions within weeks of treatment initiation were in the ciprofloxacin group versus in the comparator group The most frequent adverse reactions were gastrointestinal of ciprofloxacin patients compared to of comparator patients Serious adverse reactions were seen in of ciprofloxacin treated patients compared to of control patients Discontinuation of drug due to an adverse reaction was observed in of ciprofloxacin treated patients versus of comparator patients Other adverse reactions that occurred in at least of ciprofloxacin patients were diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain dyspepsia nausea fever asthma and rash Short term safety data for ciprofloxacin was also collected in a randomized double blind clinical trial for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients ages to years Sixty seven patients received ciprofloxacin IV mg kg dose every hours for one week followed by ciprofloxacin tablets mg kg dose every hours to complete to days treatment and patients received the combination of ceftazidime intravenous mg kg dose every hours and tobramycin intravenous mg kg dose every hours for a total of to days Periodic musculoskeletal assessments were conducted by treatment blinded examiners Patients were followed for an average of days after completing treatment range to days Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in the comparison group Decreased range of motion was reported in of the subjects in the ciprofloxacin group and in the comparison group Arthralgia was reported in of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in the comparison group Other adverse reactions were similar in nature and frequency between treatment arms The efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients has not been established In addition to the adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials it should be expected that adverse reactions reported in adults during clinical trials or postmarketing experience may also occur in pediatric patients Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure Table Table Postmarketing Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions System Organ Class Adverse Reactions

reduction in blood glucose elevated uric acid decrease in hemoglobin anemia bleeding diathesis increase in blood monocytes and leukocytosis DRUG INTERACTIONS Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P A CYP A mediated metabolism Co administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP A results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co administered drug Table Drugs That are Affected by and Affecting Ciprofloxacin Drugs That are Affected by Ciprofloxacin Drug s Recommendation Comments Tizanidine Contraindicated Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine see Contraindications Theophylline Avoid Use Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased and Prolonged Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may result in increased risk of a patient developing central nervous system CNS or other adverse reactions If concomitant use cannot be avoided monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate see Warnings and Precautions Drugs Known to Prolong QT Interval Avoid Use Ciprofloxacin may further prolong the QT interval in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval for example class IA or III antiarrhythmics tricyclic antidepressants macrolides antipsychotics see Warnings and Precautions and Use in Specific Populations Oral antidiabetic drugs Use with caution Glucose lowering effect potentiated Hypoglycemia sometimes severe has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents mainly sulfonylureas for example glyburide glimepiride were co administered presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent Fatalities have been reported Monitor blood glucose when ciprofloxacin is co administered with oral antidiabetic drugs see Adverse Reactions Phenytoin Use with caution Altered serum levels of phenytoin To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels and to prevent phenytoin overdose related adverse reactions upon ciprofloxacin discontinuation in patients receiving both agents monitor phenytoin therapy including phenytoin serum concentration during and shortly after co administration of ciprofloxacin with phenytoin increased and decreased Cyclosporine Use with caution transient elevations in serum creatinine Monitor renal function in particular serum creatinine when ciprofloxacin is co administered with cyclosporine Anti coagulant drugs Use with caution Increase in anticoagulant effect The risk may vary with the underlying infection age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin to the increase in INR international normalized ratio is difficult to assess Monitor prothrombin time and INR frequently during and shortly after co administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anti coagulant for example warfarin Methotrexate Use with caution Inhibition of methotrexate renal tubular transport potentially leading to increased methotrexate plasma levels Potential increase in the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions Therefore carefully monitor patients under methotrexate therapy when concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy is indicated Ropinirole Use with caution Monitoring for ropinirole related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co administration with ciprofloxacin see Warnings and Precautions Clozapine Use with caution Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co administration with ciprofloxacin are advised NSAIDs Use with caution Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs but not acetyl salicylic acid in combination of very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre clinical studies and in postmarketing Sildenafil Use with caution Two fold increase in exposure Monitor for sildenafil toxicity see Clinical Pharmacology Duloxetine Avoid Use If unavoidable monitor for duloxetine toxicity Five fold increase in duloxetine exposure Caffeine Xanthine Derivatives Use with caution Reduced clearance resulting in elevated levels and prolongation Ciprofloxacin inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration or pentoxifylline containing products Monitor for xanthine toxicity and adjust dose as necessary of serum half life Co administration with ciprofloxacin may increase blood levels of zolpidem concurrent use is not recommended Zolpidem Avoid Use Drug s Affecting Pharmacokinetics of Ciprofloxacin Antacids Sucralfate Multivitamins and Other Products Containing Multivalent Cations magnesium aluminum antacids polymeric phosphate binders for example sevelamer lanthanum carbonate sucralfate Videx didanosine chewable buffered tablets or pediatric powder other highly buffered drugs or products containing calcium iron or zinc and dairy products Ciprofloxacin should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after Multivalent cation containing products administration see Dosage and Administration Decrease ciprofloxacin absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels Probenecid Use with caution interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and increases ciprofloxacin serum levels Potentiation of ciprofloxacin toxicity may occur USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged experience with ciprofloxacin in pregnant women over several decades based on available published information from case reports case control studies and observational studies on ciprofloxacin administered during pregnancy have not identified any drug associated risk of major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes see Data Oral administration of ciprofloxacin during organogenesis at doses up to mg kg to pregnant mice and rats and up to mg kg to pregnant rabbits did not cause fetal malformations see Data These doses were up to and times the maximum recommended clinical oral dose in mice rats and rabbits respectively based on body surface area The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect loss or other adverse outcomes In the U S general population the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to and to respectively Data Human Data While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk published data from prospective observational studies over several decades have not established an association with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy and major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes Available studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and some of them are not specific for ciprofloxacin A controlled prospective observational study followed women exposed to fluoroquinolones exposed to ciprofloxacin and first trimester exposures during gestation In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations The reported rates of major congenital malformations were for the fluoroquinolone group and for the control group background incidence of major malformations is to Rates of spontaneous abortions prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children Another prospective follow up study reported on pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure first trimester exposures There were ciprofloxacin exposures all within the first trimester The malformation rates among live born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin No differences in the rates of prematurity spontaneous abortions or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy However these small postmarketing epidemiology studies of which most experience is from short term first trimester exposure are insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses Animal Data Developmental toxicology studies have been performed with ciprofloxacin in rats mice and rabbits In rats and mice oral doses up to mg kg administered during organogenesis Gestation Days GD to were not associated with adverse developmental outcomes including embryofetal toxicity or malformations In rats and mice a mg kg dose is approximately and times the maximum daily human oral dose mg day based upon body surface area respectively In a series of rabbit developmental toxicology studies does received oral or intravenous ciprofloxacin for one of the following day periods GD to GD to or GD to intended to cover the period of organogenesis This was an attempt to mitigate the gastrointestinal intolerance observed in rabbits that receive antibacterials manifested by reduced maternal food consumption and weight loss that can lead to embryofetal resorption or spontaneous abortion An oral ciprofloxacin dose of mg kg approximately times the highest recommended clinical oral dose based on body surface area caused excessive maternal toxicity confounding evaluation of the fetuses A mg kg oral dose approximately times the highest recommended clinical oral dose was associated with suppression of maternal and fetal body weight gain but fetal malformations were not observed Intravenous administration of doses up to mg kg approximately times the highest recommended clinical oral dose based upon body surface area to pregnant rabbits was not maternally toxic and neither embryofetal toxicity nor fetal malformations were observed In peri and post natal studies rats received ciprofloxacin doses up to mg kg day oral or up to mg kg day subcutaneous from GD to days postpartum The mg kg dose is approximately times the maximum recommended clinical oral dose based on body surface area Neither maternal toxicity nor adverse effects on growth and development of the pups were observed including no sign of arthropathy on the rear leg joints of the pups Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested when administered directly see Warnings and Precautions and Nonclinical Toxicology Lactation Risk Summary Published literature reports that ciprofloxacin is present in human milk following intravenous and oral administration There is no information regarding effects of ciprofloxacin on milk production or the breastfed infant Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants including arthropathy shown in juvenile animal studies see Use in Specific Populations Clinical Considerations for most indications a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with ciprofloxacin and an additional two days five half lives after the last dose Alternatively advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ciprofloxacin and for an additional two days five half lives after the last dose However for inhalation anthrax post exposure during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax the risk benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother and potentially the infant is are on ciprofloxacin may be acceptable see Dosage and Administration Pediatric Use and Clinical Studies The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother s clinical need for ciprofloxacin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ciprofloxacin or from the underlying maternal condition Clinical Considerations Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis thrush diaper rash Pediatric Use Although effective in clinical trials ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls Quinolones including ciprofloxacin cause arthropathy arthralgia arthritis in juvenile animals see Warnings and Precautions and Nonclinical Toxicology Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis Ciprofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli in pediatric patients to years of age Although effective in clinical trials ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to the controls including events related to joints and or surrounding tissues see Adverse Reactions and Clinical Studies Inhalational Anthrax Post Exposure Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients from birth to years of age for inhalational anthrax post exposure The risk benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate see Dosage and Administration and Clinical Studies Plague Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients from birth to years of age for treatment of plague including pneumonic and septicemic plague due to Yersinia pestis Y pestis and prophylaxis for plague Efficacy studies of ciprofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for feasibility reasons Therefore approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals The risk benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate see Indications and Usage Dosage and Administration and Clinical Studies Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles hand shoulder or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur see Boxed Warning Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones particularly in elderly patients see Warnings and Precautions In a retrospective analysis of multiple dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over ciprofloxacin treated patients of patients were greater than or equal to years of age and were greater than or equal to years of age No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than years of age with normal renal function However since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients see Dosage and Administration and Clinical Pharmacology In general elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug associated effects on the QT interval Therefore precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval for example class IA or class III antiarrhythmics or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes for example known QT prolongation uncorrected hypokalemia see Warnings and Precautions Renal Impairment Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion however the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment Nonetheless some modification of dosage is recommended particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction see Dosage and Administration and Clinical Pharmacology Hepatic Impairment In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency have not been studied OVERDOSAGE In the event of acute overdosage reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment including monitoring of renal function urinary pH and acidify if required to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium aluminum or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin Adequate hydration must be maintained Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin less than is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis DESCRIPTION Ciprofloxacin tablets USP are synthetic antimicrobial agents for oral administration Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride USP

a delay in the absorption of the drug resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to hours after dosing rather than hour The overall absorption of ciprofloxacin tablet however is not substantially affected Avoid concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with dairy products like milk or yogurt or calcium fortified juices alone since decreased absorption is possible however ciprofloxacin may be taken with a meal that contains these products With oral administration a mg dose given as mL of the ciprofloxacin suspension containing mg ciprofloxacin mL is bioequivalent to the mg tablet A mL volume of the ciprofloxacin suspension containing mg ciprofloxacin mL is bioequivalent to a mL volume of the ciprofloxacin suspension containing mg ciprofloxacin mL Distribution The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is to which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs After oral administration ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women particularly in genital tissue including the prostate Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva nasal and bronchial secretions mucosa of the sinuses sputum skin blister fluid lymph peritoneal fluid bile and prostatic secretions Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung skin fat muscle cartilage and bone The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid CSF however CSF concentrations are generally less than of peak serum concentrations Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye Metabolism Four metabolites have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately of an oral dose The metabolites have antimicrobial activity but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P A CYP A mediated metabolism Co administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP A results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co administered drug see Contraindications Warnings and Precautions and Drug Interactions Excretion The serum elimination half life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately hours Approximately to of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug After a mg oral dose urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed mcg mL during the first two hours and are approximately mcg mL at to hours after dosing The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within hours after dosing The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin which is approximately mL minute exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of mL minute Thus active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination Co administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug An additional to of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites Approximately to of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within days after dosing This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination Specific Populations Elderly Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral single dose and intravenous single and multiple dose forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects older than years as compared to young adults Although the C max is increased to the increase in mean AUC is approximately and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly Elimination half life is only slightly prolonged in the elderly These differences are not considered clinically significant see Use in Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with reduced renal function the half life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged Dosage adjustments may be required see Use in Specific Populations and Dosage and Administration Hepatic Impairment In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency have not been fully studied Pediatrics Table summarizes pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients aged less than to less than years of age receiving intravenous treatment

Less than year to less than years to less than years to less than years These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various infections the predicted mean half life in children is approximately hours to hours and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately Drug Drug Interactions Antacids Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as see Dosage and Administration and Drug Interactions Histamine H receptor antagonists Histamine H receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin Metronidazole The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly Tizanidine In a pharmacokinetic study systemic exposure of tizanidine mg single dose was significantly increased C max fold AUC fold when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin mg twice a day for days Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine see Contraindications Ropinirole In a study conducted in patients with Parkinson s disease who were administered mg ropinirole once daily with mg ciprofloxacin twice daily the mean C max and mean AUC of ropinirole were increased by and respectively Monitoring for ropinirole related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co administration with ciprofloxacin see Warnings and Precautions Clozapine Following concomitant administration of mg ciprofloxacin with mg clozapine for days serum concentrations of clozapine and N desmethylclozapine were increased by and respectively Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co administration with ciprofloxacin are advised Sildenafil Following concomitant administration of a single oral dose of mg sildenafil with mg ciprofloxacin to healthy subjects the mean C max and mean AUC of sildenafil were both increased approximately two fold Use sildenafil with caution when co administered with ciprofloxacin due to the expected two fold increase in the exposure of sildenafil upon co administration of ciprofloxacin Duloxetine In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP A isozyme such as fluvoxamine may result in a fold increase in mean AUC and a fold increase in mean C max of duloxetine Lidocaine In a study conducted in healthy volunteers concomitant use of mg kg IV lidocaine with ciprofloxacin mg twice daily resulted in an increase of lidocaine C max and AUC by and respectively Although lidocaine treatment was well tolerated at this elevated exposure a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin and an increase in adverse reactions related to lidocaine may occur upon concomitant administration Metoclopramide Metoclopramide significantly accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin resulting in a shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations No significant effect was observed on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin Omeprazole When ciprofloxacin was administered as a single mg dose concomitantly with omeprazole mg once daily for three days to healthy volunteers the mean AUC and C max of ciprofloxacin were reduced by and respectively The clinical significance of this interaction has not been determined Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV both Type II topoisomerases which are required for bacterial DNA replication transcription repair and recombination Mechanism of Resistance The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin is different from that of penicillins cephalosporins aminoglycosides macrolides and tetracyclines therefore microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by either mutations in the DNA gyrases decreased outer membrane permeability or drug efflux In vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin develops slowly by multiple step mutations Resistance to ciprofloxacin due to spontaneous mutations occurs at a general frequency of between to x Cross Resistance There is no known cross resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections see Indications and Usage Gram positive bacteria Bacillus anthracis Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus methicillin susceptible isolates only Staphylococcus epidermidis methicillin susceptible isolates only Staphylococcus saprophyticus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram negative bacteria Campylobacter jejuni Citrobacter koseri Citrobacter freundii Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis

Shigella dysenteriae Shigella flexneri Shigella sonnei Yersinia pestis The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown At least percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration MIC less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ciprofloxacin against isolates of similar genus or organism group However the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well controlled clinical trials Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus haemolyticus

Salmonella Microsome Test Negative E coli DNA Repair Assay Negative Mouse Lymphoma Cell Forward Mutation Assay Positive Chinese Hamster V Cell HGPRT Test Negative Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation Assay Negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae Point Mutation Assay Negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay Negative Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay Positive Thus of the tests were positive but results of the following in vivo test systems gave negative results Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay Micronucleus Test Mice Dominant Lethal Test Mice Long term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to mg kg and mg kg to rats and mice respectively approximately and times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area respectively Results from photo co carcinogenicity testing indicate that ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control Hairless Skh mice were exposed to UVA light for hours five times every two weeks for up to weeks while concurrently being administered ciprofloxacin The time to development of the first skin tumors was weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and ciprofloxacin mouse dose approximately equal to maximum recommended human dose based upon body surface area as opposed to weeks when animals were treated with both UVA and vehicle The times to development of skin tumors ranged from weeks to weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and other quinolones In this model mice treated with ciprofloxacin alone did not develop skin or systemic tumors There are no data from similar models using pigmented mice and or fully haired mice The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown Fertility studies performed in male and female rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to mg kg approximately times the highest recommended therapeutic oral dose based upon body surface area revealed no evidence of impairment Male rats received oral ciprofloxacin for weeks prior to mating and females were dosed for weeks prior to mating through Gestation Day Animal Toxicology and or Pharmacology Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested see Warnings and Precautions Damage of weight bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats In young beagles mg kg ciprofloxacin given daily for weeks caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint At mg kg the effect on the joint was minimal In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs oral ciprofloxacin doses of mg kg and mg kg ciprofloxacin approximately times and times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs given daily for weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment free period of months At mg kg approximately times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs no effects on joints were observed This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment free period of months In another study removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them Crystalluria sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions which predominate in the urine of test animals in man crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic In rhesus monkeys crystalluria without nephropathy was noted after single oral doses as low as mg kg approximately times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area After months of intravenous dosing at mg kg day no nephropathological changes were noted however nephropathy was observed after dosing at mg kg day for the same duration approximately times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area In dogs ciprofloxacin at mg kg and mg kg by rapid intravenous injection sec produces pronounced hypotensive effects These effects are considered to be related to histamine release since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine an antihistamine In rhesus monkeys rapid intravenous injection also produces hypotension but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced In mice concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin treated animals CLINICAL STUDIES Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis Efficacy in Pediatric Patients Ciprofloxacin administered intravenously and or orally was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients to years of age mean age of years The trial was conducted in the U S Canada Argentina Peru Costa Rica Mexico South Africa and Germany The duration of therapy was

Bacteriologic Eradication of the Baseline Pathogen at to Days Post Treatment Escherichia coli Inhalational Anthrax in Adults and Pediatrics The mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival in the rhesus monkey model of inhalational anthrax are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving oral and intravenous regimens Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in various human populations The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady state in human adults receiving mg orally every hours is mcg mL and mcg mL following mg intravenously every hours The mean trough serum concentration at steady state for both of these regimens is mcg mL In a study of pediatric patients between and years of age the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is mcg mL and trough concentrations range from mcg mL to mcg mL following two minute intravenous infusions of mg kg administered hours apart After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to mg kg orally every hours achieve a mean peak concentration of mcg mL after the initial oral dose Long term safety data including effects on cartilage following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication A placebo controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of LD x spores range to LD of B anthracis was conducted The minimal inhibitory concentration MIC of ciprofloxacin for the anthrax strain used in this study was mcg mL In the animals studied mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected T max hour post dose following oral dosing to steady state ranged from mcg mL to mcg mL Mean steady state trough concentrations at hours post dose ranged from mcg mL to mcg mL Mortality due to anthrax for animals that received a day regimen of oral ciprofloxacin beginning hours post exposure was significantly lower compared to the placebo group p The one ciprofloxacin treated animal that died of anthrax did so following the day drug administration period More than persons were recommended to complete a minimum of days of antibacterial prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to B anthracis during Ciprofloxacin was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen Some persons were also given anthrax vaccine or were switched to alternative antibacterial drugs No one who received ciprofloxacin or other therapies as prophylactic treatment subsequently developed inhalational anthrax The number of persons who received ciprofloxacin as all or part of their post exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown Plague A placebo controlled animal study in African green monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of LD range to LD of Yersinia pestis CO strain was conducted The minimal inhibitory concentration MIC of ciprofloxacin for the Y pestis strain used in this study was mcg mL Mean peak serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at the end of a single minute infusion were mcg mL mcg mL mcg mL mcg mL and mcg mL mcg mL on Day Day and Day of treatment in African green monkeys respectively All trough concentrations Day Day and Day were mcg mL Animals were randomized to receive either a day regimen of intravenous ciprofloxacin mg kg or placebo beginning when animals were found to be febrile a body temperature greater than C over baseline for two hours or at hours post challenge whichever occurred sooner Mortality in the ciprofloxacin group was significantly lower compared to the placebo group difference exact confidence interval to The one ciprofloxacin treated animal that died did not receive the proposed dose of ciprofloxacin due to a failure of the administration catheter Circulating ciprofloxacin concentration was below mcg mL at all timepoints tested in this animal It became culture negative on Day of treatment but had a resurgence of low grade bacteremia on Day after treatment initiation Terminal blood culture in this

discontinue ciprofloxacin and consult a physician Lactation For indications other than inhalational anthrax post exposure advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ciprofloxacin and for an additional days after the last dose Alternatively a woman may pump and discard during treatment and for additional days after the last dose see Use in Specific Populations Antibacterial Resistance Inform patients that antibacterial drugs including ciprofloxacin tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections They do not treat viral infections for example the common cold When ciprofloxacin tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy the medication should be taken exactly as directed Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ciprofloxacin tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future Administration Instructions Inform patients that ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with or without food Inform patients to drink fluids liberally while taking ciprofloxacin tablets to avoid formation of highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine Inform patients

infection sinus infection skin infection bone and joint infection nosocomial pneumonia intra abdominal infection complicated infectious diarrhea typhoid enteric fever cervical and urethral gonorrhea uncomplicated people with a low white blood cell count and a fever inhalational anthrax plague Studies of ciprofloxacin tablets for use in the treatment of plague and anthrax were done in animals only because plague and anthrax could not be studied in people Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis acute uncomplicated cystitis and sinus infections if there are other treatment options available Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine to treat lower respiratory tract infections caused by a certain type of bacterial called Streptococcus pneumoniae Ciprofloxacin tablets are also used in children younger than years of age to treat complicated urinary tract and kidney infections or who may have breathed in anthrax germs have plague or have been exposed to plague germs Children younger than years of age have a higher chance of getting bone joint or tendon musculoskeletal problems such as pain or swelling while taking ciprofloxacin tablets Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine in children under years of age Who should not take

PageData and Supplemental Information Related Publications Download Document Table of Contents At a Glance This report examines research and development R D by the pharmaceutical industry Spending on R D and Its Results Spending on R D and the introduction of new drugs have both increased in the past two decades In the pharmaceutical industry spent billion dollars on R D Adjusted for inflation that amount is about times what the industry spent per year in the s Between and the number of new drugs approved for sale increased by percent compared with the previous decade with a peak of new drugs approved in Factors Influencing R D Spending The amount of money that drug companies devote to R D is determined by the amount of revenue they expect to earn from a new drug the expected cost of developing that drug and policies that influence the supply of and demand for drugs The expected lifetime global revenues of a new drug depends on the prices that companies expect to charge for the drug in different markets around the world the volume of sales they anticipate at those prices and the likelihood the drug development effort will succeed The expected cost to develop a new drug including capital costs and expenditures on drugs that fail to reach the market has been estimated to range from less than billion to more than billion The federal government influences the amount of private spending on R D through programs such as Medicare that increase the demand for prescription drugs through policies such as spending for basic research and regulations on what must be demonstrated in clinical trials that affect the supply of new drugs and through policies such as recommendations for vaccines that affect both supply and demand Notes Notes To remove the effects of inflation the Congressional Budget Office adjusted dollar amounts with the gross domestic product price index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Amounts are expressed in dollars Research and Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry Summary Every year the U S pharmaceutical industry develops a variety of new drugs that provide valuable medical benefits Many of those drugs are expensive and contribute to rising health care costs for the private sector and the federal government Policymakers have considered policies that would lower drug prices and reduce federal drug expenditures Such policies would probably reduce the industry s incentive to develop new drugs In this report the Congressional Budget Office assesses trends in spending for drug research and development R D and the introduction of new drugs CBO also examines factors that determine how much drug companies spend on R D expected global revenues from a new drug cost to develop a new drug and federal policies that affect the demand for drug therapies the supply of new drugs or both What Are Recent Trends in Pharmaceutical R D and New Drug Approvals The pharmaceutical industry devoted billion to R D expenditures in Those expenditures covered a variety of activities including discovering and testing new drugs developing incremental innovations such as product extensions and clinical testing for safety monitoring or marketing purposes That amount is about times what the industry spent per year in the s after adjusting for the effects of inflation The share of revenues that drug companies devote to R D has also grown On average pharmaceutical companies spent about one quarter of their revenues net of expenses and buyer rebates on R D expenses in which is almost twice as large a share of revenues as they spent in That revenue share is larger than that for other knowledge based industries such as semiconductors technology hardware and software The number of new drugs approved each year has also grown over the past decade On average the Food and Drug Administration FDA approved new drugs per year from through with a peak of in which is percent more than the yearly average over the previous decade Many of the drugs that have been approved in recent years are specialty drugs Specialty drugs generally treat chronic complex or rare conditions and they may also require special handling or monitoring of patients Many specialty drugs are biologics large molecule drugs based on living cell lines which are costly to develop hard to imitate and frequently have high prices Previously most drugs were small molecule drugs based on chemical compounds Even while they were under patent those drugs had lower prices than recent specialty drugs have Information about the kinds of drugs in current clinical trials indicates that much of the industry s innovative activity is focused on specialty drugs that would provide new cancer therapies and treatments for nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease What Factors Influence Spending for R D Drug companies R D spending decisions depend on three main factors Anticipated lifetime global revenues from a new drug Expected costs to develop a new drug and Policies and programs that influence the supply of and demand for prescription drugs Various considerations inform companies expectations about a drug s revenue stream including the anticipated prices it could command in different markets around the world and the expected global sales volume at those prices given the number of people who might use the drug The prices and sales volumes of existing drugs provide information about consumers and insurance plans willingness to pay for drug treatments Importantly when drug companies set the prices of a new drug they do so to maximize future revenues net of manufacturing and distribution costs A drug s sunk R D costs that is the costs already incurred in developing that drug do not influence its price Developing new drugs is a costly and uncertain process and many potential drugs never make it to market Only about percent of drugs entering clinical trials are ultimately approved for introduction by the FDA In recent studies estimates of the average R D cost per new drug range from less than billion to more than billion per drug Those estimates include the costs of both laboratory research and clinical trials of successful new drugs as well as expenditures on drugs that do not make it past the laboratory development stage that enter clinical trials but fail in those trials or are withdrawn by the drugmaker for business reasons or that are not approved by the FDA Those estimates also include the company s capital costs the value of other forgone investments incurred during the R D process Such costs can make up a substantial share of the average total cost of developing a new drug The development process often takes a decade or more and during that time the company does not receive a financial return on its investment in developing that drug The federal government affects R D decisions in three ways First it increases demand for prescription drugs which encourages new drug development by fully or partially subsidizing the purchase of prescription drugs through a variety of federal programs including Medicare and Medicaid and by providing tax preferences for employment based health insurance Second the federal government increases the supply of new drugs It funds basic biomedical research that provides a scientific foundation for the development of new drugs by private industry Additionally tax credits both those available to all types of companies and those available to drug companies for developing treatments of uncommon diseases provide incentives to invest in R D Similarly deductions for R D investment can be used to reduce tax liabilities immediately rather than over the life of that investment Finally the patent system and certain statutory provisions that delay FDA approval of generic drugs provide pharmaceutical companies with a period of market exclusivity when competition is legally restricted During that time they can maintain higher prices on a patented product than they otherwise could which makes new drugs more profitable and thereby increases drug companies incentives to invest in R D Third some federal policies affect the number of new drugs by influencing both demand and supply For example federal recommendations for specific vaccines increase the demand for those vaccines and provide an incentive for drug companies to develop new ones Additionally federal regulatory policies that influence returns on drug R D can bring about increases or decreases in both the supply of and demand for new drugs Trends in R D Spending and New Drug Development Private spending on pharmaceutical R D and the approval of new drugs have both increased markedly in recent years resuming a decades long trend that was interrupted in as generic versions of some top selling drugs became available and as the recession occurred In particular spending on drug R D increased by nearly percent between and Many of the drugs approved in recent years are high priced specialty drugs for relatively small numbers of potential patients By contrast the top selling drugs of the s were lower cost drugs with large patient populations R D Spending R D spending in the pharmaceutical industry covers a variety of activities including the following Invention or research and discovery of new drugs Development or clinical testing preparation and submission of applications for FDA approval and design of production processes for new drugs Incremental innovation including the development of new dosages and delivery mechanisms for existing drugs and the testing of those drugs for additional indications Product differentiation or the clinical testing of a new drug against an existing rival drug to show that the new drug is superior and Safety monitoring or clinical trials conducted after a drug has reached the market that the FDA may require to detect side effects that may not have been observed in shorter trials when the drug was in development In real terms private investment in drug R D among member firms of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America PhRMA an industry trade association was about billion in up from about billion in and billion in Although those spending totals do not include spending by many smaller drug companies that do not belong to PhRMA the trend is broadly representative of R D spending by the industry as a whole A survey of all U S pharmaceutical R D spending including that of smaller firms by the National Science Foundation NSF reveals similar trends Although total R D spending by all drug companies has trended upward small and large firms generally focus on different R D activities Small companies not in PhRMA devote a greater share of their research to developing and testing new drugs many of which are ultimately sold to larger firms see Box By contrast a greater portion of the R D spending of larger drug companies including those in PhRMA is devoted to conducting clinical trials developing incremental line extension improvements such as new dosages or delivery systems or new combinations of two or more existing drugs and conducting postapproval testing for safety monitoring or marketing purposes Box Large and Small Drug Companies and the Make or Buy Decision Small drug companies those with annual revenues of less than million now account for more than percent of the nearly drugs in phase III clinical trials They are also responsible for a growing share of drugs already on the market Since about one third of the new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been developed by pharmaceutical firms with annual revenues of less than million Large drug companies those with annual revenues of billion or more still account for more than half of new drugs approved since and an even greater share of revenues but they have only initiated about percent of drugs currently in phase III clinical trials For a large drug company one option for increasing the number of drugs it expects to introduce is to acquire a smaller firm that is developing new drugs Over the past three decades about one fifth of drugs in development or the companies developing them have been acquired by another pharmaceutical company When a large company acquires a small drug company or the rights to one of its drugs it can use its specialized knowledge to increase the value of its acquisition or to diversify its risk of a decline in revenues from a drug s loss of patent protection for instance In making that acquisition a large company might bring a drug to market more quickly than the small company could have or might distribute it more widely With the rise of generic drugs the loss in sales revenues that occurs when a drug s patent expires can leave firms with excess capacity in production Acquiring a smaller company can help quickly fill that capacity The acquisition of a small company by a larger one can create efficiencies that might increase the combined value of the firms by allowing drug companies of different sizes in terms of the number of researchers administrative employees and financial and physical assets to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage Small companies with relatively fewer administrative staff less expertise in conducting clinical trials and less physical and financial capital to manage can concentrate primarily on research For their part large drug companies are much better capitalized and can more easily finance and manage clinical trials They also have readier access to markets through established drug distribution networks and relationships with buyers Researchers have found some evidence that such acquisitions by larger drug firms are sometimes motivated by large firms desire to limit competition According to a recent study of acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry for example a company was about percent to percent less likely to complete the development of drugs in its acquired company s pipeline if those drugs would compete with the acquirer s existing drugs than it would be otherwise In a study of competition and research and development R D the Government Accountability Office cited several retrospective studies of mergers in the drug industry that found such transactions reduced R D spending and patenting for several years The reverse was also true Increases in pharmaceutical industry competition have been found to increase firms R D spending See IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science The

relied on the PhRMA data because before the NSF survey did not include domestic firms R D spending outside of the United States Both the NSF and PhRMA estimates reflect worldwide R D spending by pharmaceutical companies with operations in the United States NSF s estimates of R D spending since suggest that PhRMA members worldwide R D spending constitutes about percent to percent of the industry total depending on the year In recent years the pharmaceutical industry s R D spending as a share of net revenues sales less expenses and rebates has increased Consumer spending on brand name prescription drugs has risen but R D spending has risen more quickly In the early s when drug industry revenues were rising sharply the industry s R D intensity that is its R D spending as a share of net revenues averaged about percent each year Over the decade from to the industry s R D intensity averaged percent to percent each year That ratio has been trending upward since and it exceeded percent in and the highest R D intensities recorded by the pharmaceutical industry as a whole since at least Data are limited for earlier years but among PhRMA member companies annual R D intensities averaged percent from through and never exceeded percent Since then R D intensity has increased among PhRMA firms just as it has for the industry as a whole reaching percent in before decreasing slightly in By comparison average R D intensity across all industries typically ranges between percent and percent R D intensity in the software and semiconductor industries which are generally comparable to the drug industry in their reliance on research and development has remained below percent see Figure Figure Average R D Intensities for Publicly Traded U S Companies by Industry Percent

January https tinyurl com yd hq t See www cbo gov publication data R D intensity is research and development spending as a share of net revenues sales less expenses and rebates R D research and development S P Standard and Poor s There are several possible explanations for the increase in the industry s R D intensity over the past eight years It could reflect the increased role of small drug companies which have little revenue and therefore high ratios of R D spending to net revenues It could also indicate that the expected returns from investments in R D have increased if market conditions have changed or that opportunities to develop new drugs have increased if recent advances in science and technology have been particularly productive Finally it could reflect rising costs of R D inputs such as capital equipment and skilled labor CBO has not evaluated the relative importance of those possibilities New Drug Development Over the past decade the pharmaceutical industry has introduced growing numbers of new drugs annually see Figure Between and new drugs were approved each year on average That is about a percent increase compared with the previous decade Drug approvals reached a new peak in surpassing the record number of approvals of the late s Counts of new drug approvals are a readily available but imperfect measure of output from the drug industry s R D spending The measure does not reflect differences in the effectiveness of the new drugs relative to alternative treatments or the number of people who might benefit from the new drugs Figure Average Annual Approvals of New Drugs by the FDA Number of Drugs From to the FDA approved about twice as many new drugs as it did a decade earlier Biologic drugs make up a growing share of FDA approvals Data source

kinds of new drugs the pharmaceutical industry has introduced can be inferred from changes in retail spending across different therapeutic classes of drugs When ranked by retail spending therapeutic classes in which many expensive specialty drugs have been introduced over the past decade top the ranking whereas classes in which the best selling drugs are now available in generic form rank lower now than they did a decade ago Information about the kinds of new drugs the pharmaceutical industry may introduce in the future can be inferred from clinical trials under way Approval of New Drugs Over the past five years both R D spending and drug approvals have increased substantially The relationship between them is complex and variable see Figure Because it can take a decade or more of R D spending to develop a new drug and successfully shepherd it through clinical trials drug approvals lag behind the underlying R D spending That lag makes it difficult to interpret the relationship between R D spending and new drug approvals For instance drug approvals declined over the s despite steadily rising R D spending over the preceding years provoking concerns about a decline in the industry s R D productivity Those concerns proved temporary however Despite flat R D spending from through drug approvals began to increase around Figure R D Spending and New Drug Approvals Sustained increases in pharmaceutical R D spending do not necessarily lead to rising numbers of new drugs R D spending also reflects rising costs of labor skilled researchers and capital laboratory technologies

annual value and the preceding four is used A moving average is smoother than the underlying data series and is useful for reducing year to year changes unrelated to overall trends in the data That increase in drug approvals does not by itself indicate the extent to which the new drugs are particularly innovative for instance targeting illnesses in new ways as opposed to improving only incrementally upon existing drugs Furthermore the recent trend of sharply rising R D spending does not necessarily portend a continued high rate of drug introductions A decline in clinical trials success rates for example could slow the rate of new drug introductions even while R D spending continued to increase Additionally not all R D spending is directed toward development of new drugs Drug companies devote some R D resources to finding effective new combinations of existing drugs as with newer HIV treatments and preventatives or to new drug delivery mechanisms such as insulin pumps Finally the rise in the industry s R D spending does not provide information about the kinds of drugs that may be introduced in coming years To some degree that information can be inferred from descriptions of clinical trials currently in progress But it cannot be known with any certainty which of those drugs will eventually make it to market Trends in Recent Drug Spending by Therapeutic Class New or improved specialty drugs for diabetes various cancers autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis and HIV have propelled large retail spending increases in the therapeutic classes for those illnesses see Figure Many of the new specialty drugs are biologics based on living cell lines rather than chemical active ingredients For HIV the new antiretroviral therapies have been combinations of specialty drugs that simplify treatment Figure Total U S Retail Drug Spending by Therapeutic Class and Billions of dollars New drugs can lead to large increases in retail spending because they have higher prices they are in high demand or both Spending decreases can result when patent protection expires on leading drugs and low cost generic versions are

spending overstates actual spending and revenues received by manufacturers because it does not include rebates paid by those manufacturers ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder GI gastrointestinal a Viral hepatitis entered the list of the top therapeutic classes by retail spending in therefore spending levels for that year have been substituted for levels Some of the therapeutic classes that have experienced large spending increases feature new drugs with relatively large populations of patients or new treatments for chronic conditions that can be therapeutically managed but require continued treatment As a result drugs for chronic conditions typically sell in steady quantities Other such classes include new drugs with relatively small numbers of potential patients or shorter treatment durations but that have high prices per unit of treatment High prices may reflect demand that is relatively insensitive to price because of the serious nature of the illness and coverage of those drugs by insurance plans For example prices for oncology drugs tend to be high In some cases observed increases in retail spending overstate increases in net revenues to the manufacturer because they do not account for unobserved rebates Rebates tend to be higher for drugs for which several competing therapies are available Larger rebates correspond with lower net prices Thus rebates on diabetes drugs tend to be considerably higher as a percentage of the retail price than they do for oncology drugs which are not highly substitutable Several therapeutic classes that contain top selling drugs developed in the s experienced decreases in retail spending from to as they faced competition from generic versions Those blockbuster small molecule drugs include atypical antipsychotics ACE inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors The therapeutic classes containing those drugs mental health antihypertensives and gastrointestinal products respectively experienced large declines in retail spending One therapeutic class lipid regulators the class that includes statins experienced such a decrease that it no longer appears among the top ranked by retail spending Those declines reflect widespread use of the new generic versions of those drugs One therapeutic class has experienced a decline in retail spending for a different reason Viral hepatitis only entered the top in coinciding with the introduction of several highly effective and high priced new treatments for hepatitis C In contrast to the spending declines described above the decline in retail spending on viral hepatitis drugs is attributable to a combination of factors First newer lower priced drugs have since been introduced lowering the average price in that class as they have gained market share Second the number of prescriptions has declined As the treatments have been administered the number of potential patients has fallen That is because the new drugs successfully treat about percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection By contrast older less expensive therapies were successful in far fewer patients and had severe side effects in many cases Types of New Drugs in Development Information about the kinds of drugs that may be approved in coming years can be gleaned from data on recent clinical trials That information suggests that drug companies are emphasizing treatments for cancer and nervous system disorders like Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease Among human clinical trials in progress as of drugs in those two therapeutic classes accounted for more than twice as many trials as did drugs in the next three classes combined vaccines pain including arthritis therapies and dermatologics The coronavirus pandemic has spurred the development of vaccines to halt the spread of COVID the disease caused by the coronavirus In addition to R D spending by the private sector the federal government has provided support to the private sector to develop vaccines to address the pandemic see Box Box Federal Funding to Support the Development of a COVID Vaccine The federal government can directly support private vaccine development in two primary ways either by covering the costs of research and development R D or by committing in advance to purchasing a successful vaccine contingent upon a firm achieving specified development goals Under the first method the government would supply R D funding that would ordinarily come from the pharmaceutical firms themselves from venture capital investments or from other sources outside the firm That method might be better suited to cases in which the R D effort had a relatively high risk of failure and an expected return that would be too low to attract private investment The rationale for government funding in such cases would depend on whether the expected value to society rather than to private investors exceeded the cost of the funding However a drawback of such funding is that the outside funder including the government in this case cannot observe the innovator s private costs and may pay more than necessary for developing the vaccine Under the second method that is agreeing to a future purchase of a specified number of vaccine doses at a specific price the government would become the source of demand that ordinarily comes from the market Such an advance purchase agreement might be preferable in cases in which the government planned to purchase the new product in large quantities regardless of the amount of financial support it provided for R D It might also be preferable in cases in which a variety of approaches to developing the product are available but with much uncertainty about which approach is best An advance purchase agreement would also ensure the developer a certain amount of revenues in cases in which the government was supporting the development of multiple competing products simultaneously By offering advance purchase contracts to vaccine manufacturers the promise of future payment conditional on a successful vaccine being developed the government can provide greater certainty to pharmaceutical firms undertaking risky investments in R D for vaccines In May the Department of Health and Human Services initiated Operation Warp Speed a collaborative effort involving the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Food and Drug Administration FDA the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense with funding provided through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA Through Operation Warp Speed the federal government has provided more than billion in assistance to seven private pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop and produce a vaccine or treatment for COVID the disease caused by the coronavirus see the table below As of March five of those seven companies accepted up front funding for research and clinical trials Five of the seven companies accepted advance funding aimed at helping manufacturers ramp up their production capabilities while their potential vaccines were still in development a sixth accepted funding to develop the capacity to manufacture another firm s vaccine after it received emergency use authorization Finally six of the seven manufacturers signed advance purchase agreements Two of the companies with vaccines that have received emergency use authorizations have received additional funding for selling more doses than were guaranteed by advance purchase agreements The parallel execution of several stages of development that would usually be conducted in sequence such as combining phase I and phase II clinical trials or building manufacturing capacity while the trials are still under way has allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers to advance much more quickly through the development process than is typical for vaccines One year after the first case of COVID was diagnosed in the United States three of the vaccines supported by BARDA funding had received emergency use authorizations from the FDA and two other vaccines were in phase III clinical trials It ordinarily takes several years of research and testing before a candidate vaccine enters phase III clinical trials Seasonal influenza vaccines take much less time to develop and approve because their technologies and the regulatory and licensing procedures for those vaccines have been used before According to the World Health Organization more than candidate COVID vaccines were in development in February Most of the manufacturers have also received research support from or signed advance purchase agreements with the European Union several national governments and two global partnerships supported by foundations and other donors

invest in R D in anticipation of future profits For each drug that a company considers pursuing anticipated returns depend on three main factors the expected lifetime global revenue from the drug minus its manufacturing and marketing costs the new drug s likely R D costs and policies that affect the supply of and demand for prescription drugs When the anticipation of future profits is higher companies invest more in R D and produce more new drugs CBO estimates Similarly if expectations about prices and profits were lower companies would invest in less R D and fewer drugs would be developed see Box Box Effects of Changes in Expected Profitability on the Introduction of New Drugs If expected profitability of new drugs declined because of a change in federal policy a shift in demand or supply a revision in the balance of power between drug companies and drug buyers or for any other reason the expected returns on drug R D would decline as well Lower expected returns would probably mean fewer new drugs because there would be less incentive for companies to spend on R D If expected profitability were to rise the opposite effects would occur Expectations about returns on R D partly depend on expectations of prices that future drugs could command which in turn partly depend on current drug prices and influences on those prices The Congressional Budget Office s analysis of H R in the th Congress illustrates those effects That bill would have required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for drugs primarily those for which spending was highest and to subject manufacturers who did not participate in negotiations to an excise tax In that analysis CBO concluded that the bill would reduce drug companies expectations about future revenues because of the new negotiating leverage of the Secretary The prospect of such lower revenues would make investments in R D less attractive to pharmaceutical companies CBO estimated that under the bill approximately fewer drugs would be introduced to the U S market over the period and about fewer drugs over the subsequent years Those estimates were in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes in CBO s assessment and were uncertain CBO s analysis is in line with a broader literature that has found a positive relationship between drug prices and R D efforts See

Market Size and Pharmaceutical Innovation RAND Journal of Economics vol no Winter pp https doi org Anticipated Revenues A company s expectations about the revenues it could earn from a drug depend on the prices that the company anticipates the drug could command in various markets around the world and the quantities that the company anticipates might be purchased at those prices Those expectations are informed by the prices and sales volumes observed for existing drugs in various markets For established drug companies current revenue streams from existing products also provide an important source of financing for their R D projects How Revenue Expectations are Formulated A company develops its expectations about a potential drug s lifetime future revenues based on the drug s potential market size which depends on the prices it might command in sales to different patient groups and in negotiations with payers domestically and abroad In that sense the prices of existing drugs including variations in prices to different patient populations help determine R D spending on future drugs The converse is not true In CBO s assessment current R D spending does not influence the future prices of the drugs that result from that spending Revenues generated by existing drugs provide information about the potential market size for new drugs by indicating consumers and insurance plans willingness to pay for drug treatments The number of prescriptions for those drugs support inferences about the number of potential patients their propensity to use drug therapies at the observed prices and the popularity of competing therapies Sales revenues from other unrelated drugs also help companies form expectations about market size They reveal information about the magnitude of drug treatment costs that the market currently tolerates both in general and for various conditions that will have more or less in common with regard to duration severity or effects on quality or length of life with the conditions the new drug would treat Expected revenues also depend on anticipated unit sales in different markets around the world Those quantities are determined by the number of potential patients for the drug in those markets the shares of those populations that might buy the drug at the prices the manufacturer envisions for those markets taking into account any substitute drugs that might be available and the number of prescriptions a course of treatment would require Once a new drug has been approved CBO expects that its developer would set its price in a forward looking fashion meaning the price is set to maximize the net revenues from the drug without regard to how much it cost to develop Real inflation adjusted pharmaceutical revenues increased sharply from the mid s until around the mid s when patents on a number of blockbuster drugs expired and lower cost generic equivalents were introduced Revenues then declined slightly from the mid s through the mid s a result of those patent expirations and the recession Revenue growth returned with the introduction of some expensive new drugs see Figure Figure Worldwide and Domestic Revenues of PhRMA Member Firms Billions of Dollars Revenues from drug sales have grown substantially since although that growth was interrupted by patent expirations of some widely used drugs and by the recession

PDF MB See www cbo gov publication data PhRMA revenue data reflect payments received by manufacturers excluding cash discounts Medicaid rebates returns and allowances for marketing expenses PhRMA Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Revenues as Source of Funding for R D In the pharmaceutical industry revenues have traditionally been an important source of R D financing for established companies with brand name drugs to sell Brand name drugs can generate large volumes of cash because their manufacturing and distribution costs are typically very low relative to their sales revenues Established companies appear to prefer to finance their R D with current revenues whenever possible rather than to rely on outside funding sources such as venture capital Outside financing involves transactions costs as well as other implicit costs such as compensation for risks borne by outside investors who cannot perfectly monitor a firm s efforts and skills The share of R D funded directly by revenues has declined in recent years because an increasing amount of R D is now conducted by research oriented drug companies with few or no products on the market Over the past decade small or emerging drug companies have developed a rising share of new drugs Those companies have relatively little revenue some have none at all and most of them must seek outside financing such as venture capital and collaborative agreements with larger drug companies Although venture capital still only finances a small share of the drug industry s R D spending in total it supports a much larger share of the R D spending of smaller firms than of large established companies Drug development also occurs in university research labs In addition to grants funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH that many universities receive for performing basic biomedical research universities may collaborate with and be funded by private drug companies to perform applied research toward the development of new drugs The funding for that R D may come predominantly from revenues as the collaborations typically involve established pharmaceutical companies R D Costs of a New Drug R D spending is also influenced by the expected costs of developing a new drug including those incurred in the preclinical research phase and in clinical trials In addition to those out of pocket expenses drug companies incur capital costs that result from tying up funds in the drug development process for years before they generate earnings from those investments Those capital costs reflect the returns that the funds could have earned if they had been invested in other ways Development of a drug that will eventually reach the market often entails a decade or more of R D expenditures Each successive phase of clinical trials requires increasing amounts of spending Drug developers can reassess their commitment at each stage and a drug s expected value may change as more is learned in clinical trials or as market conditions change that is there is an option value to continuing Companies will not necessarily cancel a drug project even if its likely future costs exceed its likely value when that assessment is made because the expected value might rise with additional information about the drug or its market Pharmaceutical research is inherently risky and canceled or failed projects are a normal part of any drug development program Companies initiate drug projects knowing that most of them will not yield a marketable drug Some drugs developed in the preclinical phase never enter clinical trials and of those that do only about percent reach the market recent estimates range from percent to percent Estimates from multiple sources of average R D expenditures per new drug range from less than billion to more than billion Those estimates all include capital costs as well as expenditures on drugs that did not make it to market The different estimates are averages over different samples of companies and drugs that is they depend on analytical and sampling choices made by the researchers producing those estimates and are best interpreted as illustrative of the general conclusion that developing new drugs is expensive and subject to high rates of failure Preclinical Phase Although drugs spend much less time in preclinical development than they do in clinical trials a company s total preclinical R D expenditures typically constitute a considerable share of its total R D spending That is because companies typically develop many potential drugs in the preclinical phase that never enter or complete clinical trials According to one estimate using data provided by large pharmaceutical firms preclinical development accounted for an average of percent of a company s total expenditures on drug R D or million per approved new drug When capital costs were taken into account the share of R D spending in the preclinical phase rose to percent Any return on R D spending on early preclinical drug development must await successful completion of both the preclinical phase and the clinical trials that follow As a result the lag between investment and return is longer for R D spending that occurs in the preclinical phase than for spending in clinical trials For drugs that do not reach the market no return is realized although lessons learned from those efforts may aid the development of other drugs According to one study the preclinical phase takes an average of about months followed by around months on average for clinical trials or about years from start to finish Other estimates differ in a sample of cancer drugs for example one study found that the median time from discovery to approval was years Those numbers are measures of central tendency Some drugs are brought to market in less time Clinical Trials Phase The costs to conduct clinical trials on a drug are higher than those to conduct the preclinical phase because trials involve the contributions of many more people for a longer time Clinical trials occur in several phases Phase I trials also known as human safety trials test a potential new drug at different dosage levels generally in a small group of healthy volunteers in order to assess its safety in humans For drugs with high levels of expected toxicity phase I trial subjects are people with the targeted illness Phase II trials are larger and include only people with the medical condition the drug is intended to treat Phase II trials assess the drug s biological activity and identify and characterize any side effects Phase III trials are larger still and assess a drug s clinical effectiveness They can take years to complete The smaller a drug s expected therapeutic effect relative to a placebo the larger the number of patients that are needed in the drug s phase III trials so that the drug s true effect if any can be distinguished from random variation in patient outcomes Phase IV trials also known as pharmacovigilance trials may be conducted after a new drug has reached the market They look for side effects not seen in earlier trials and measure a drug s efficacy over longer periods of use than were studied in earlier trials Generally only drugs that have successfully navigated the first three phases can be considered for FDA approval although regulators sometimes approve new drugs without a phase III trial Of the drugs approved in did not undergo phase III trials before approval In some cases the FDA may require a phase IV trial after the drug is approved to detect adverse reactions that might not be observed until a drug is in wider use Drug companies also might choose to conduct phase IV trials to show for marketing purposes the superiority of their product over other available drug therapies Few of the drugs that enter clinical trials are ultimately approved some fail in clinical trials and others are set aside when a company decides to focus on more promising drugs In a few cases drugs submitted for approval are rejected by the FDA In one sample of drugs in clinical trials researchers found that for every drugs entering phase I trials around advanced to phase II trials just over entered phase III trials and only about gained FDA approval Such winnowing is reflected in the average R D cost per approved drug which includes all of the R D spending on drugs that do not reach the market Costs tend to rise in each successive phase of development In the sample just described companies spent an average of about million in clinical trials per approved new drug more than twice the amount spent in the preclinical research phase Spending averaged million in phase I million in phase II and million in phase III For each drug that completed the first three phases of clinical trials the average total cost of those trials was about million The remaining million of the million in average total spending on clinical trials reflects companies contemporaneous spending on drugs that failed in clinical trials or were otherwise set aside Capital Costs of R D In addition to the cost of preclinical research and clinical trials drug companies incur costs by forgoing other opportunities for investment with money spent on clinical trials Because drug companies R D spending on a drug occurs over many years those capital costs are substantial and can approach the value of actual R D expenditures to develop a new drug Estimates of Total R D Costs Three recent studies have estimated the average R D cost per new drug They all measure R D costs the same way They add up all of the R D spending by each company in their sample not only its spending on the sampled new drug but the company s spending on other drugs that were being developed at the same time but that did not reach the market The studies also all apply a cost of capital adjustment to each company s R D spending to reflect the lag between investment and return on investment Despite their methodological similarities the studies estimates range from billion to billion of R D spending per new drug Differences in sample selection and data sources appear to be important sources of variation in those estimates The largest estimate billion from a study expressed here in dollars includes around million in preclinical research spending and billion for clinical trials Those estimates are based on a sample of randomly selected drugs from large pharmaceutical firms of which are ranked among the industry s top by sales revenues with an additional ranked in the top but outside the top That widely cited study is the latest in a series of similar studies the authors have published over the past three decades Because the R D expenditures reported by the sampled firms are not publicly available it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which the results of those studies are affected by the selection of the sample and other aspects of the method of collecting data An independent effort to replicate an earlier iteration of the study found similar results however The second study which was conducted in part to provide an alternative to those estimates found an average R D cost of billion expressed here in dollars with expenditures for individual drugs ranging from million to billion That upper bound based on one outlier drug accounting for billion in actual R D outlays and billion in capital costs skews the average estimate upward The median R D cost unaffected by the outlier is billion The sample in that study consisted of drugs developed by different companies out of the drugs that the FDA approved between and R D expenditure data for those drugs are publicly available unlike the data used in the study The sample skews toward smaller firms although the same is now true of drug development generally and the authors caution that their sample may overrepresent drugs approved between and and those in certain therapeutic areas first in class drugs orphan drugs and therapeutic agents that received accelerated approval The R D data include the companies spending on drugs that did not reach the market In the third study researchers limited their sample to new cancer drugs from companies with no previously approved products They found an average cost of billion per approved drug expressed here in dollars Notably that study excluded R D spending by firms that had not developed any approved drugs and thus the study underestimates R D spending on failed drugs and by extension expected costs per new drug Median observed R D costs in that sample were about billion per new drug with estimates for individual drugs ranging from about million to billion including capital costs Those estimates include the developers total R D spending while the approved drugs were under development including that on failed drugs Trends in R D Costs R D costs have increased by about percent per year over roughly the past decade The increase in average R D costs might reflect changes in the kinds of drugs being developed or in the number of drugs in costly clinical trials If success rates for new biologic drugs were lower than for traditional small molecule drugs or if R D spending on failed drugs was higher for biologics that would also contribute to higher average R D costs Some evidence suggests that average success rates may indeed have declined The study found that fewer than percent of the drugs entering phase I clinical trials ultimately reached the market but it reported success rates in excess of percent for drugs developed in the s and s However other evidence suggests that the overall success rate of clinical trials has not declined Another possible factor in rising R D costs is that it has become harder to recruit candidate patients into some kinds of clinical trials For example prospective patients might be less interested in taking a chance on untested treatments in clinical trials when approved treatment options are relatively effective already And in some therapeutic classes it has become more difficult to demonstrate that a new drug would improve on the existing standard of care For example advances in oncology treatments have extended cancer patients expected lifespans As a result clinical trials on potential cancer drugs have had to be expanded or extended so that the treatment effect on the lifespans of patients can be estimated with suitable precision That is because oncology treatments have become more effective it now takes longer on average to observe a given number of deaths in a clinical trial Public Policy Federal policy influences pharmaceutical companies R D spending both in magnitude and direction Policies in other countries and at other levels of government can also affect such spending Those policies are outside the scope of this report Policies around federal health care programs and subsidies most directly affect the demand for new drugs Other policies affect the supply of new drugs federal support for basic research tax treatment of R D spending and those policies that affect market exclusivity Still other areas of federal policymaking affect both supply and demand vaccine policies and regulatory policies Changes in policy that increased the demand for pharmaceuticals or encouraged their supply would tend to make R D activity a more attractive investment Policy changes in the opposite direction could make it a less appealing one Federal Health Care Programs and Subsidies A variety of federal health care programs and subsidies increase demand for health care services and products including prescription drugs Such initiatives indirectly stimulate spending on drug R D In particular the federal government through Medicare Medicaid TRICARE the Veterans Health Administration the Children s Health Insurance Program and health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act purchases or subsidizes the purchase of a substantial number of prescription drugs on behalf of retirees veterans persons with disabilities and low income households Taken together federal and state expenditures on prescription drugs accounted for about percent of total U S retail expenditures on prescription drugs in Changes to those programs would influence R D spending For instance when Medicare Part D Medicare s prescription drug benefit was implemented in sales of prescription drugs to enrollees increased considerably In addition for Medicare enrollees with full Medicaid benefits coverage of prescription drugs shifted from Medicaid to Medicare Part D increasing the average prices paid for those enrollees brand name drugs Those increases in current and anticipated revenues encouraged the industry to develop new drugs for the Medicare population Between and the number of drugs entering phase I clinical trials increased by roughly percent in therapeutic classes with relatively high sales to Medicare enrollees That increased development activity eventually led to increases in the number of drugs in those classes The federal government also increases demand for prescription drugs by subsidizing employment based health insurance An employer s contribution toward the cost of that coverage is excluded from an employee s taxable income effectively reducing its price to the employee As a result many people select more generous health insurance coverage than they otherwise would which increases their spending on health care including prescription drugs and indirectly stimulates pharmaceutical R D That stimulus would disappear if the tax subsidy on employment based health insurance was eliminated The size of the effect that would have on R D spending would depend on how the elimination of the subsidy would affect individuals choices of health insurance coverage Support for Basic Research The federal government is the primary funder of basic research in biomedical sciences That research ultimately increases the supply of new drugs because drug companies rely on the findings from that research for example the identification of disease targets toward which new drug therapies can be aimed That basic research creates knowledge that in effect reduces private companies R D costs and stimulates private investment in R D because it expands the set of potentially profitable drug development opportunities In particular increases in basic health related research at the NIH or other federal research agencies have been found to increase private drug R D in therapeutic classes related to that basic research The rationale for public investment in basic biomedical research is that private firms incentives to invest in it are muted Basic research generates knowledge such as the identification of a disease target that is not readily embodied in a marketable product such as a drug The more of that information a company could keep to itself the greater its value to the company and the stronger the company s incentive would be to invest in that research But because information can be communicated at low cost it can be difficult to contain within a firm Private companies tend to be reluctant to conduct basic research such as identifying a new disease target because it would be difficult to keep much of the value of that discovery for themselves For example once a disease target is known multiple companies not just the company that identified it might be able to develop drugs aimed at that target That weakens private incentives to invest in basic research and as a result private firms do too little of it from the perspective of society as a whole meaning that the social benefit if they performed additional basic research would be greater than the cost The Role of NIH Funded Research In the past two decades federal funding for NIH has totaled over billion Much of that funding has supported basic research in genomics molecular biology and other life sciences that has identified new disease mechanisms Federal support for NIH nearly doubled between and rising from billion to about billion see Figure Federal funding for NIH declined in inflation adjusted dollars each year from to when that funding was about billion With real annual increases over the subsequent five years funding for NIH reached billion in Figure Federal Funding for the National Institutes of Health Fiscal Years to Billions of Dollars Large increases in funding for NIH the locus of much of the federal government s basic biomedical research support in the late s and early s preceded a decade of declining funding Since NIH funding has increased annually Data source Congressional Budget Office using data from National Institutes of Health Office of Budget See www cbo gov publication data NIH National Institutes of Health Between and every drug approved by the FDA was in some way based on biomedical research funded by NIH In many cases new drugs targeted a disease mechanism that had been identified by advances in basic science resulting from that funding Indeed most of the important new drugs introduced by the pharmaceutical industry over the past years were developed with the aid of research conducted in the public sector Publicly funded basic science thus provided the foundation upon which complementary work on the applied science of drug development could be undertaken by the private sector How NIH Funded Research Affects Private R D Empirical studies find that public sector research tends to increase private R D rather than to decrease it that is they are complements not substitutes Several recent studies have associated increases in NIH funded basic research with increased private R D efforts One study found that in the decade following an increase in NIH funding private R D spending grew by about eight times as much as the increase in that funding Another study found that for every two NIH research grants about one new private sector patent was awarded The complementary relationship between public and private R D spending arises mainly because NIH funding focuses on basic research that leads to the discovery of new drugs whereas private spending focuses on applications of such research Private R D spending on clinical testing incremental innovation product differentiation and safety all follows from basic research That relationship is complicated by two factors First the distinction between basic and applied research is not well defined and the likelihood that federal research spending crowds out private R D spending varies by type of research The risk of crowding out is greater when the government funds research whose potential commercial applications are obvious and valuable as was the case when federal and private research labs raced to map the human genome Second federal research spending can also indirectly crowd out private spending by increasing the demand for skilled researchers That could cause an increase in research labor costs in the private sector as well as in the public sector Tax Treatment of R D Spending The tax code increases the supply of new drugs in two ways First it provides tax credits for certain R D expenditures including credits available to all types of companies and credits specifically for developing drug treatments for uncommon diseases Second it allows all types of companies to deduct expenditures that are not eligible for the credits as business expenses in the year they are made Both incentives encourage R D spending by reducing its cost to the company Tax Incentives The research and experimentation tax credit available to all types of companies for certain qualifying R D expenditures directly reduces the amount of income tax a company owes That tax credit has been modified over time and was made permanent by the Consolidated Appropriations Act Public Law Some of the increase in R D spending by pharmaceutical industries over the past several decades might have been a response to changes in that credit In addition the Orphan Drug Act P L enacted in created a tax credit to encourage the development of drugs to treat relatively uncommon diseases Companies can also choose to deduct the cost of R D investments immediately rather than over the life of the investment Many companies use both tax credits and the ability to accelerate their deductions for investments in R D although only one tax preference may be used for any particular investment expense Effects of the Tax Act The net effect of P L originally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and called the tax act in this report on R D investment is uncertain Investment in R D is encouraged by the reduction in the top corporate tax rate from percent to percent because earnings on new drugs would be taxed at a lower rate Investment is discouraged by changes in how deductions for R D expenditures can be taken The act is expected to reduce the value of tax deductions for R D when they take effect Beginning in companies will deduct their annual R D costs over a five year period rather than receiving the full tax deduction in the year the expenses are incurred That discourages investment in R D because the value of that deduction will decline The reduction in the top corporate tax rate will further reduce the value of the tax deduction The tax act also reduced the tax credit created by the Orphan Drug Act from percent to percent of the cost of clinical trials When combined with the lower tax rate that change will reduce the first year tax benefits for R D spending on orphan drugs by about percent Costs applied to the tax credit for orphan drugs cannot also be applied to the research and experimentation credit nor can they be deducted as expenses That change will also discourage investment in drug R D Policies Affecting Market Exclusivity The federal government has adopted a variety of policies that grant periods of market exclusivity to manufacturers in order to increase the supply of new drugs During those periods the average prices for those new drugs are higher than they will be later once lower priced generic versions are allowed to enter the market The return on R D spending provided by those higher prices encourages companies to develop new drugs That incentive is not unlimited A manufacturer only receives market exclusivity over its own drug There may be competing drugs in the same therapeutic market and companies may introduce other new drugs into that market providing they do not infringe the existing drugs patents The primary way that the federal government grants innovators temporary market exclusivity is through the U S patent system Most patents expire years after the date on which the patent application was filed but pharmaceutical companies can receive several additional years of patent protection in recognition that patented drugs cannot be sold until they complete clinical trials Drug patent applications are often filed before the drug enters clinical trials because disclosures from those trials could be considered prior art that might invalidate a patent if its application were filed after those disclosures occurred In recognition that a drug might spend several years of its market exclusivity in clinical trials earning no revenue the Hatch Waxman Act P L allows pharmaceutical companies to seek up to five years of additional patent protection Pharmaceutical companies can also receive additional exclusivity distinct from that afforded by patents for drugs that treat relatively uncommon diseases The Orphan Drug Act enacted in offers seven years of market exclusivity for the designated orphan use irrespective of remaining patent life for drugs that either treat conditions affecting fewer than persons in the United States or that in the FDA s judgment face market conditions making it unlikely that an innovator could recover its R D costs The Orphan Drug Act appears to have led to an increase in the number of new drugs for rare diseases Policies Affecting Generic Drugs In addition to extending the period of market exclusivity on brand name drugs the Hatch Waxman Act enacted in also supports the development of generic drugs It extends drug patents by up to five years but encourages competition from generic drugs once the patents on a pioneering drug have expired The legislation allows the FDA to approve most generic drugs without clinical trials Instead a manufacturer must show that its drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand name drug it copies with the same active ingredients and no significant differences in the rate and extent of absorption at the site of drug action in the body The legislation also allows the FDA to extend by three years a brand name drug s market exclusivity for incremental changes such as new indications dosing regimens or patient populations The FDA only grants that additional exclusivity when the manufacturer has conducted clinical trials that the agency judges were essential Thus the act strengthened incentives to develop new drugs by extending drug patent life and it made it easier for lower cost generic versions to be introduced when the drugs enter the public domain by allowing the FDA to approve most generics based on pharmaceutical equivalence rather than clinical trials Policies Affecting Biosimilar Drugs Congress has sought to provide inducement to the development of biosimilar drugs the analog for biologic drugs of the generic copies of small molecule drugs The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act P L created an abbreviated pathway for FDA approval of biosimilar drugs The manufacturer of a proposed biosimilar drug must demonstrate that the drug is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from the pioneering biologic drug In addition biosimilar manufacturers do not need to conduct as many clinical trials as were conducted for the pioneering drug because they can cite the FDA s safety and effectiveness determinations for the original biologic drug So far that legislation has resulted in relatively few approved biosimilar drugs compared to the effect that the Hatch Waxman Act had on the development of generic drugs As of December the FDA had approved only biosimilar drugs and not all of them have been introduced Of the billion in reported domestic retail spending on biologic drugs in expressed here in dollars billion was spent on biologics for which biosimilar versions are available and only billion was spent on those biosimilars The relative lack of competition for pioneering biologic drugs might contribute to the shift in new drug development toward biologic drugs instead of small molecule drugs In part that shift might simply reflect advances in the underlying science But biologic drugs are also attractive targets of research because they are harder to copy The patent system does not require the original innovator to share the original cell line Manufacturers seeking to make a biosimilar drug must develop their own living cell line to use as the basis for the new drug By contrast the primary challenge in making a generic copy of a small molecule drug is to replicate the original drug s active molecule which is publicly disclosed in the patent In addition even under the abbreviated pathway specified by the FDA biosimilar drugs must still be put through some clinical trials unlike generic drugs biosimilar drugs cannot avoid them altogether Biologic drugs may face less competition than small molecule drugs Independent of but concurrent with patent protection the FDA grants pioneering biologic drugs years of guaranteed exclusivity in contrast to years of exclusivity for small molecule drugs In addition where biologic drugs are concerned consumers may not as readily accept a biosimilar substitute as they do a generic drug because a biosimilar is not identical to the drug it imitates Consumer acceptance may be increasing with greater availability and familiarity with biosimilars However certain federal payment policies and private contractual agreements may discourage the use of biosimilars With the possibility of facing less competition even beyond the period of market exclusivity makers of biologic drugs would anticipate greater lifetime sales of those drugs as well Vaccine Policies Several federal policies increase the demand for vaccines and therefore R D spending to develop them The federal Vaccines for Children program provides vaccines at no cost to children who might otherwise go unvaccinated because of their family s inability to pay Additionally the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a schedule of recommended childhood and adult vaccinations including specific recommendations for various groups such as health care providers travelers expectant mothers racial and ethnic populations and people with certain underlying health conditions Those recommendations induce individuals to have themselves and their children vaccinated and federal subsidies lower the costs to consumers of those vaccinations A study that analyzed the effects of such policies found that the recommendation in that infants be vaccinated against hepatitis B and the expansion of Medicare coverage to include the cost of influenza vaccination in were both associated with subsequent increases in the development of new vaccines Those findings suggest that manufacturers expected demand for vaccines to increase as a result of the new recommendations Federal policies also affect the supply of vaccines The same study considered the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund which was established in to encourage manufacturers to develop and supply new vaccines by indemnifying the manufacturers against lawsuits arising from adverse reactions to childhood vaccines The study found that the fund s introduction was associated with increased development of new vaccines In the federal government invested directly in the development of vaccines by providing more than billion in funding to support the private development of vaccines to prevent COVID through its Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority see Box Regulatory Policies Federal regulatory policies that affect either drug supply or drug demand can influence drug companies returns on R D spending which would in turn affect the amount they were willing to spend on R D Proposed regulation of some drug prices would affect the sales volumes of existing drugs and as a result expected returns on R D on future drugs in turn lower expected returns would result in fewer new drugs Changes to regulation of clinical trials would also affect the supply of new drugs Drug Prices U S markets are subject to less price regulation than are the markets in many other countries Drug companies can mostly set their own prices although some federal agencies purchase drugs at prices subject to a statutory cap impose statutory limits on how quickly a manufacturer can raise its prices or receive rebates from manufacturers that are specified in statute In the House of Representatives passed H R which would have required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers over the domestic prices of certain high priced single source drugs to ensure that they were no more than percent higher than the average prices for those drugs in specific other countries Under H R drug manufacturers that did not agree to participate in negotiations or that failed to agree to a negotiated price would have been subject to an excise tax The combination of income taxes and excise taxes on a drug s sales might have caused the manufacturer to lose money if the drug were sold in the United States Those taxes would have had the same effect as if the drug had not been approved for sale or as if there were a formulary that is a national list of drugs that insurers could cover from which the drug was excluded Therefore the potential use of the excise tax would have served as a source of pressure on drug manufacturers in negotiations and would have lowered drug prices and federal spending CBO estimated For a discussion of the effects of lower prices on the introduction of new drugs see Box More generally state laws mandating or encouraging substitution of generic drugs for their brand name equivalents help lower drug prices In addition most Medicare Part D plans encourage the substitution of generic drugs for their brand name equivalents And although the existence of generic drugs is enabled by the patent system s disclosure requirement compelling drugmakers to disclose the molecular structure of a drug s active ingredient several federal regulatory decisions hasten the introduction of those drugs Under the Hatch Waxman Act generic drugs shown to contain the same active ingredient as the pioneering drug do not need to be tested in clinical trials as described above The act also provides legal protections from claims of patent infringement to manufacturers who try to develop generic versions of a pioneering drug before its patents have expired and from liability for adverse events not listed on the label of the pioneering drug That competition from generic drugs which can also reduce the demand for new drugs entering those markets has tended to discourage investment in drug R D Several studies have found that a real percent decrease in the growth of drug prices would be associated with about a percent decrease in pharmaceutical R D spending as a share of net revenues Clinical Trials A substantial R D expense that can account for more than half of R D spending excluding capital costs clinical trials are conducted in accordance with federal requirements As a result changes to federal policy regarding clinical trials can meaningfully affect private R D spending In particular policymakers have made several changes to federal regulations governing clinical trials in an effort to reduce the time they take and therefore lower their cost For example FDA s guidance described above on how drug companies can establish bioequivalence between a biosimilar drug and the pioneering biologic drug is intended to minimize the expenses of clinical trials associated with developing biosimilar drugs The Prescription Drug User Fee Act enacted in provided the FDA with additional resources to hasten the drug approval process which reduced both the time to market and the capital costs of new drug development More recently federal policymakers have allowed the use of surrogate endpoints in drug trials for certain illnesses including HIV infection and some cancers to shorten some clinical trials Surrogate endpoints include indirect predictive indicators such as blood pressure cholesterol level tumor size T cell counts or other physical signs of disease along with other test results and laboratory measures The FDA can approve certain kinds of drug for sale in the U S based on clinical trials results that rely on such surrogate measures rather than on direct measures of a drug s clinical benefit The use of surrogate endpoints has helped neutralize a tendency in privately funded research to emphasize treatments that can be commercialized more quickly which can result in too little investment in clinically valuable treatments that would take longer to develop Speedier clinical trials can also benefit patients by hastening the introduction of life extending therapies like the HIV antiretroviral treatments developed in the s However relying on surrogate endpoints means that consumers might spend money on some drugs that would turn out to have little clinically meaningful effect See Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America PhRMA Annual Membership Survey PhRMA https tinyurl com ydh p t and PhRMA Annual Membership Survey PhRMA https

uses edit Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections including infections of bones and joints endocarditis gastroenteritis malignant otitis externa respiratory tract infections cellulitis urinary tract infections prostatitis anthrax and chancroid Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold For certain uses including acute sinusitis lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea ciprofloxacin is not considered a first line agent Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections especially those likely to be caused by Gram negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa For example ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole is one of several first line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of community acquired abdominal infections in adults It also features prominently in treatment guidelines for acute pyelonephritis complicated or hospital acquired urinary tract infection acute or chronic prostatitis certain types of endocarditis certain skin infections and prosthetic joint infections In other cases treatment guidelines are more restrictive recommending in most cases that older narrower spectrum drugs be used as first line therapy for less severe infections to minimize fluoroquinolone resistance development For example the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower spectrum drugs such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole The European Association of Urology recommends ciprofloxacin as an alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections but cautions that the potential for adverse events have to be considered Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections ciprofloxacin is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae Respiratory quinolones such as levofloxacin having greater activity against this pathogen are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in patients with important co morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization Infectious Diseases Society of America Similarly ciprofloxacin is not recommended as a first line treatment for acute sinusitis Ciprofloxacin is approved for the treatment of gonorrhea in many countries but this recommendation is widely regarded as obsolete due to resistance development Pregnancy edit In the United States ciprofloxacin is pregnancy category C This category includes drugs for which no adequate and well controlled studies in human pregnancy exist and for which animal studies have suggested the potential for harm to the fetus but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by the Teratogen Information System concluded therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk quantity and quality of data fair but the data are insufficient to state no risk exists Exposure to quinolones including levofloxacin during the first trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths premature births birth defects or low birth weight Two small post marketing epidemiology studies of mostly short term first trimester exposure found that fluoroquinolones did not increase risk of major malformations spontaneous abortions premature birth or low birth weight The label notes however that these studies are insufficient to reliably evaluate the definitive safety or risk of less common defects by ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses Breastfeeding edit Fluoroquinolones have been reported as present in a mother s milk and thus passed on to the nursing child The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA recommends that because of the risk of serious adverse reactions including articular damage in infants nursing from mothers taking ciprofloxacin a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother Children edit Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system Inhalational anthrax postexposure Complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli but never as first line agents Current when recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics note the systemic use of ciprofloxacin in children should be restricted to infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens or when no safe or effective alternatives are available Spectrum of activity edit Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for community acquired pneumonias bronchitis urinary tract infections and gastroenteritis Ciprofloxacin is particularly effective against Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but is less effective against Gram positive bacteria such as methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis than newer fluoroquinolones Bacterial resistance edit See also Antibiotic abuse and Antibiotic resistance As a result of its widespread use to treat minor infections readily treatable with older narrower spectrum antibiotics many bacteria have developed resistance to this drug in recent years leaving it significantly less effective than it would have been otherwise Resistance to ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly even during a course of treatment Numerous pathogens including enterococci Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae quinolone resistant now exhibit resistance Widespread veterinary usage of fluoroquinolones particularly in Europe has been implicated Meanwhile some Burkholderia cepacia Clostridium innocuum and Enterococcus faecium strains have developed resistance to ciprofloxacin to varying degrees Fluoroquinolones had become the class of antibiotics most commonly prescribed to adults in Nearly half of those prescriptions in the U S were for conditions not approved by the FDA such as acute bronchitis otitis media and acute upper respiratory tract infection according to a study supported in part by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Additionally they were commonly prescribed for medical conditions that were not even bacterial to begin with such as viral infections or those for which no proven benefit existed Contraindications edit Contraindications include Taking tizanidine at the same time Use by those who are hypersensitive to any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents Use by those who are diagnosed with myasthenia graves as muscle weakness may be exacerbated Ciprofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated in children except for the indications outlined above in pregnancy to nursing mothers and in people with epilepsy or other seizure disorders Caution may be required in people with Marfan syndrome or Ehlers Danlos syndrome Adverse effects edit Adverse effects can involve the tendons muscles joints nerves and the central nervous system Rates of adverse effects appear to be higher than with some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than with others such as clindamycin Compared to other antibiotics some studies find a higher rate of adverse effects while others find no difference In clinical trials most of the adverse events were described as mild or moderate in severity abated soon after the drug was discontinued and required no treatment Some adverse effects may be permanent Ciprofloxacin was stopped because of an adverse event in of people treated with the medication by mouth The most frequently reported drug related events from trials of all formulations all dosages all drug therapy durations and for all indications were nausea diarrhea abnormal liver function tests vomiting and rash Other adverse events occurred at rates of Tendon problems edit Ciprofloxacin includes a boxed warning in the United States due to an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture especially in people who are older than years people who also use corticosteroids and people with kidney lung or heart transplants Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the medication One study found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a fold increase in tendon problems The risk increased to in those over years of age and to in those over the age of who were also taking corticosteroids Among the quinolone users in the study cases of Achilles tendon rupture were identified Cardiac arrhythmia edit The fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin are associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity including QT interval prolongation torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death Nervous system edit Because Ciprofloxacin is lipophilic it has the ability to cross the blood brain barrier The FDA label warns of nervous system effects Ciprofloxacin like other fluoroquinolones is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold and may cause other central nervous system adverse effects Headache dizziness and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS adverse effects such as tremors psychosis anxiety hallucinations paranoia and suicide attempts especially at higher doses Like other fluoroquinolones it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible such as weakness burning pain tingling or numbness Cancer edit Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight in vitro assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects but is not active in in vivo assays of genotoxicity Long term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to and mg kg to rats and mice respectively about and times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg m Results from photo co carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control Other edit The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with myasthenia gravis due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission There are concerns that fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin can affect cartilage in young children Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is a serious adverse effect of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones it is unclear whether the risk is higher than with other broad spectrum antibiotics A wide range of rare but potentially fatal adverse effects reported to the U S FDA or the subject of case reports includes aortic dissection toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens Johnson syndrome low blood pressure allergic pneumonitis bone marrow suppression hepatitis or liver failure and sensitivity to light The medication should be discontinued if a rash jaundice or other sign of hypersensitivity occurs Children and the elderly are at a much greater risk of experiencing adverse reactions Overdose edit Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or gastric lavage as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium aluminium or calcium to reduce drug absorption Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can only remove less than of ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims Interactions edit Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum highly buffered drugs sevelamer lanthanum carbonate sucralfate didanosine or with supplements containing calcium iron or zinc It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract reducing peak serum concentrations by or more leading to therapeutic failure Additionally it should not be taken with dairy products or calcium fortified juices alone as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration time curve can be reduced up to However ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium fortified juices as part of a meal Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP A and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme CYP A substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin treated patients include tizanidine theophylline caffeine methylxanthines clozapine olanzapine and ropinirole Co administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP A substrate tizanidine Zanaflex is contraindicated due to a increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP A substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting The Committee on Safety of Medicines and the FDA warn that central nervous system adverse effects including seizure risk may be increased when NSAIDs are combined with quinolones The mechanism for this interaction may involve a synergistic increased antagonism of GABA neurotransmission Altered serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine increased and decreased have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin is a potent inhibitor of CYP A CYP D and CYP A Mechanism of action edit Ciprofloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class It is active against some Gram positive and many Gram negative bacteria It functions by inhibiting a type II topoisomerase DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV necessary to separate bacterial DNA thereby inhibiting cell division Bacterial DNA fragmentation will occur as a result of inhibition of the enzymes Pharmacokinetics edit Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate release tablets extended release tablets an oral suspension and as a solution for intravenous administration When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than of peak serum concentrations The serum half life of ciprofloxacin is about hours with of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug An additional is excreted in urine as metabolites Urinary excretion is virtually complete hours after administration Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins It is an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P A which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme Ciprofloxacin is about orally available when administered orally so a slightly higher dose is needed to achieve the same exposure when switching from IV to oral administration The extended release oral tablets allow once daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract These tablets contain of the administered dose in an immediate release form and in a slow release matrix Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between and hours after administration Compared to the and mg immediate release tablets the mg and mg XR tablets provide higher Cmax but the hour AUCs are equivalent Ciprofloxacin immediate release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt as the free base Chemical properties edit Ciprofloxacin is cyclopropyl fluoro dihydro oxo piperazinyl quinolinecarboxylic acid Its empirical formula is C H FN O and its molecular weight is g mol It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride USP is the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of ciprofloxacin It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance with a molecular weight of g mol Its empirical formula is C H FN O HCl H O Usage edit Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second generation quinolones In over million prescriptions were written making it the th most commonly prescribed generic drug and the th most commonly prescribed antibacterial in the U S History edit Ciprofloxacin mg tablets from Ukraine The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine In the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency In the aftermath of this disclosure several other pharmaceutical companies initiated research and development programs with the goal of discovering additional antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone class The fluoroquinolone program at Bayer focused on examining the effects of very minor changes to the norfloxacin structure In the company published in vitro potency data for ciprofloxacin a fluoroquinolone antibacterial having a chemical structure differing from that of norfloxacin by the presence of a single carbon atom This small change led to a two to fold increase in potency against most strains of Gram negative bacteria Importantly this structural change led to a four fold improvement in activity against the important Gram negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa making ciprofloxacin one of the most potent known drugs for the treatment of this intrinsically antibiotic resistant pathogen medical citation needed The oral tablet form of ciprofloxacin was approved in October just one year after the approval of norfloxacin In the intravenous formulation was introduced Ciprofloxacin sales reached a peak of about billion euros in before Bayer s patent expired in after which annual sales have averaged around million The name probably originates from the International Scientific Nomenclature ci alteration of cycl propyl fluor ox az mycin Society and culture edit Cost edit It is available as a generic medication and not very expensive At least one company Turtle Pharma Private Limited provides industrial size amounts Generic equivalents edit On October the Prescription Access Litigation PAL project filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced generic versions of drugs Barr Laboratories Rugby Laboratories and Hoechst Marion Roussel that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper generic versions of ciprofloxacin The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation a unit of Bayer AG had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of million to prevent cheaper generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market as well as manipulating its price and supply Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit On October five years after Bayer s patent had expired the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer s and the other defendants motion for summary judgment holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law in effect upholding Bayer s agreement with its competitors Available forms edit Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate release tablets as extended release tablets as an oral suspension and as a solution for intravenous infusion It is also available for local administration as eye drops and ear drops Litigation edit A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington D C and workers at the U S Capitol along with employees of American Media Inc in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged they developed serious adverse effects from taking ciprofloxacin in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in The action alleged Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws The class action was defeated and the litigation abandoned by the plaintiffs A similar action was filed in in New Jersey by four New Jersey postal workers but was withdrawn for lack of grounds as workers had been informed of the risks of ciprofloxacin when they were given the option of taking the drug Research edit As resistance to ciprofloxacin has grown since its introduction research has been conducted to discover and develop analogs that can be effective against resistant bacteria some have been looked at in antiviral models as well References edit a b Ciprofloxacin Use During

aspirin Medically reviewed by Alan Carter Pharm D By Yvette Brazier Updated on February What is aspirin Uses In children Precautions Interactions Side effects Summary Aspirin is a common drug for relieving minor aches pains and fevers People also use it as an anti inflammatory or blood thinner People can buy aspirin over the counter without a prescription Everyday uses include relieving headache reducing swelling and reducing a fever Taken daily aspirin can lower the risk of cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke in people with a high risk Doctors may administer aspirin immediately after a heart attack to prevent further clots and heart tissue death This article provides an overview of aspirin including its uses risks interactions and possible side effects What is aspirin Share on Pinterest Image credit Adrienne Bresnahan Getty Images Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug NSAID It was the first of this class of drug to be discovered Aspirin contains salicylate a compound found in plants such as the willow tree and myrtle Its use was first recorded around years ago Hippocrates used willow bark for relieving pain and fevers and some people still use willow bark as a natural remedy for headaches and minor pain NSAIDs are a class of drug with the following effects relieving pain reducing fever lowering inflammation in higher doses These drugs are not steroids Steroids often have similar benefits to NSAIDs but they are not appropriate for everyone and can have unwanted side effects As analgesics NSAIDs tend to be non narcotic This means that they do not cause insensibility or a stupor Aspirin is a trademark owned by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer The generic term for aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid Uses Aspirin has many uses including relieving pain and swelling managing various conditions and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with a high risk Below we describe these uses in more details Pain and swelling Aspirin can relieve mild to moderate pain swelling or both associated with many health issues such as headaches a cold or flu sprains and strains menstrual cramps long term conditions such as arthritis and migraine For severe pain a doctor may recommend using aspirin alongside another drug such as an opioid pain reliever or another NSAID Preventing cardiovascular events The daily use of low dose aspirin can lower the risk of cardiovascular events in some people it is not safe for everyone The Food and Drug Administration FDA recommend only using aspirin in this way under the supervision of a doctor In people with a high risk of cardiovascular events low dose aspirin can reduce the risk by preventing blood clots from forming A doctor may recommend daily low dose aspirin for people who have a heart or blood vessel disease have evidence of poor blood flow to the brain have high blood cholesterol have high blood pressure or hypertension have diabetes smoke However for people without these issues the risks of long term aspirin use can outweigh the benefits The recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force say that adults aged may take aspirin daily to prevent colorectal cancer as well as cardiovascular disease However this guidance only applies to adults in the age range who have at least a year risk of cardiovascular disease do not have a high risk of bleeding have a life expectancy of at least years are willing to take a daily low dose for at least years Treating coronary events Doctors may administer aspirin immediately after a heart attack stroke or another cardiovascular event to prevent further clot formation and cardiac tissue death Aspirin can also be part of a treatment plan for people who have recently had revascularization surgery such as an angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery a mini stroke or transient ischemic attack an ischemic stroke which is caused by a blood clot Other uses Aspirin can also help treat pain and swelling associated with the following chronic health conditions rheumatic conditions including rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis and other inflammatory joint conditions systemic lupus erythematosus inflammation around the heart known as pericarditis Doctors may recommend low dose aspirin to people with retinal damage also called retinopathy who have had diabetes for more than years who are taking antihypertensive medications with a risk of colorectal cancer Is aspirin safe for children Doctors do not usually recommend aspirin for people under This is because it can increase the risk of a serious condition called Reye s syndrome which can appear after a viral infection such as a cold the flu or chickenpox Reye s syndrome can lead to permanent brain injury or death However a clinician may prescribe aspirin to a child under supervision if they have Kawasaki disease or to prevent blood clots from forming after heart surgery For children doctors usually recommend acetaminophen Tylenol or ibuprofen Advil in appropriate doses instead of aspirin Risks and precautions People with the following conditions should be cautious about taking aspirin and should only do so if a doctor recommends it bleeding disorders such as hemophilia uncontrolled high blood pressure asthma peptic or stomach ulcers liver or kidney disease Under a doctor s supervision people who are pregnant or breastfeeding may take low dose aspirin Doctors usually do not recommend high dose aspirin during pregnancy Anyone with a known allergy to aspirin or any other NSAID such as ibuprofen should avoid these drugs Doctors do not administer aspirin during a stroke because not all strokes are caused by blood clots In some cases aspirin could make a stroke worse Also anyone who drinks alcohol regularly or is undergoing dental or surgical treatment however small should ask a doctor before taking aspirin Drug interactions An interaction may involve one medication making another less effective or the combination being dangerous Aspirin can interact with many drugs Some of these include Anti inflammatory painkillers Examples include such as diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen Combined with aspirin these types of drugs can increase the risk of stomach bleeding Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants Examples include citalopram fluoxetine paroxetine venlafaxine and sertraline In combination with aspirin any of these can increase the risk of bleeding Warfarin In combination with this blood thinner aspirin can reduce the drug s anticoagulant effects and increase the risk of bleeding There are situations however when this combination may be beneficial Methotrexate In combination with this drug used in the treatment of cancer and some autoimmune diseases aspirin can make the drug harder to eliminate potentially resulting in levels of methotrexate that are toxic For a more complete list of drug interactions check with the National Institute for Health and Care and Excellence Side effects The most common side effects of aspirin are stomach or gut irritation indigestion nausea The following adverse effects are less common worsening asthma symptoms vomiting stomach inflammation stomach bleeding bruising Aspirin can also have very serious side effects such as bleeding in the brain or stomach or kidney failure A rare side effect of daily low dose aspirin is hemorrhagic stroke Summary Aspirin can help prevent and treat a range of health issues but people under should not take it without medical guidance Aspirin is available over the counter or by prescription Always follow the instructions on the label or a doctor s guidance This is especially crucial for people who may be more likely to experience adverse effects Aspirin is not safe for everyone especially in a daily dosage Other options for mild pain relief include other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen Read the article in Spanish Last medically reviewed on September

antithrombotic Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease pericarditis and rheumatic fever Aspirin is also used long term to help prevent further heart attacks ischaemic strokes and blood clots in people at high risk For pain or fever effects typically begin within minutes Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets One common adverse effect is an upset stomach More significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other NSAIDs or are on other blood thinners Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome High doses may result in ringing in the ears A precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree genus Salix has been used for its health effects for at least years In chemist Charles Fr d ric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time Over the next years other chemists established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods Aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions It is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated tonnes tons to billion pills clarification needed consumed each year and is on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines In it was the th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than million prescriptions Brand vs generic name edit In scientists at the Bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines By Bayer had named it Aspirin and sold it around the world Aspirin s popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to competition between many brands and formulations The word Aspirin was Bayer s brand name however their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries The name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a cetyl spir Spiraea the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at Bayer in the common chemical suffix Chemical properties edit Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates carbonates citrates or hydroxides of the alkali metals It is stable in dry air but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids In solution with alkalis the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate Like flour mills factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building because the powder air mixture can be explosive The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of mg m time weighted average In the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of mg m but this was vacated by the AFL CIO v OSHA decision in Synthesis edit The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride an acid derivative causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid s hydroxyl group into an ester group R OH R OCOCH This process yields aspirin and acetic acid which is considered a byproduct of this reaction Small amounts of sulfuric acid and occasionally phosphoric acid are almost always used as a catalyst This method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs Aspirin synthesis Reaction between acetic acid and salicylic acid can also form aspirin but this esterification reaction is reversible and the presence of water can lead to hydrolysis of the aspirin So an anhydrous reagent is preferred Reaction mechanism Acetylation of salicylic acid mechanism Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids Physical properties edit Aspirin an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid is a white crystalline weakly acidic substance which melts at C F and decomposes around C F Its acid dissociation constant pKa is at C F Polymorphism edit Polymorphism or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients Many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph For a long time only one crystal structure for aspirin was known That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the s The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in and fine structural details were given by Bond et al A new crystal type was found during experiments after co crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile The form II is only stable at K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature In the unambiguous form I two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the acidic methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds and in the newly claimed form II each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures Mechanism of action edit Main article Mechanism of action of aspirin Discovery of the mechanism edit In British pharmacologist John Robert Vane then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Sune Bergstr m and Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson Prostaglandins and thromboxanes edit Aspirin s ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase COX officially known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase PTGS enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme Suicide inhibition This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen which are reversible inhibitors Low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet days This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack unstable angina ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin I synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition Prostaglandins local hormones produced in the body have diverse effects including the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat and inflammation Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction COX and COX inhibition edit At least two different types of cyclooxygenases COX and COX are acted on by aspirin Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX COX normally produces prostanoids most of which are proinflammatory Aspirin modified PTGS prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase produces lipoxins most of which are anti inflammatory verification needed Newer NSAID drugs COX inhibitors coxibs have been developed to inhibit only PTGS with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects Several COX inhibitors such as rofecoxib Vioxx have been withdrawn from the market after evidence emerged that PTGS inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS and by selectively inhibiting PTGS prostaglandin production specifically PGI prostacyclin is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels as PTGS in platelets is unaffected Thus the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI is removed increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems Since platelets have no DNA they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors Furthermore aspirin while inhibiting the ability of COX to form pro inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins converts this enzyme s activity from a prostaglandin forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase like enzyme aspirin treated COX metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin triggered lipoxins aspirin triggered resolvins and aspirin triggered maresins These mediators possess potent anti inflammatory activity It is proposed that this aspirin triggered transition of COX from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin Additional mechanisms edit Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous and hepatic mitochondria by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons Aspirin buffers and transports the protons When high doses are given it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses In addition aspirin induces the formation of NO radicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection however evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through NF B NF B a transcription factor complex plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid which itself has anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic effects In salicylic acid was found to activate AMP activated protein kinase which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post translational level Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin Formulations edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it January Aspirin is produced in many formulations with some differences in effect In particular aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding Formulations may be combined e g buffered vitamin C Tablets typically of about mg and mg of immediate release aspirin IR ASA Dispersible tablets Enteric coated tablets Buffered formulations containing aspirin with one of many buffering agents Formulations of aspirin with vitamin C ASA VitC A phospholipid aspirin complex liquid formulation PL ASA As of the phospholipid coating was being trialled to determine if it caused less gastrointestinal damage Pharmacokinetics edit Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there as more of it is ionized Owing to the formation of concretions aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to hours after ingestion About of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin while the rest remains in the active ionized state protein binding is concentration dependent Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity The volume of distribution is L kg Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates As much as of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid With large salicylate doses the kinetics switch from first order to zero order as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid free salicylic acid salicylic phenol and acyl glucuronides gentisic acid and dihydroxybenzoic acid When small doses less than mg in an adult are ingested all pathways proceed by first order kinetics with an elimination half life of about h to h When higher doses of salicylate are ingested more than g the half life becomes much longer h to h because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH A to fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from to The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination It was found that short term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis Aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated History edit Main article History of aspirin advertisement Medicines made from willow and other salicylate rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer as well as the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt Hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around BC and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever pain and inflammation in the mid eighteenth century By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid the active component of willow extract Old package Export from Germany is prohibited In chemist Charles Fr d ric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time in the second half of the th century other academic chemists established the compound s chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis In scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines and identified a new way to synthesize it By Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it globally The word Aspirin was Bayer s brand name rather than the generic name of the drug however Bayer s rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries Aspirin s popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products Aspirin s popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen paracetamol in and ibuprofen in In the s and s John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin s effects while clinical trials and other studies from the s to the s established aspirin s efficacy as an anti clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases The initial large studies on the use of low dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the s and s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and US federal law and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the th century and remain strong in the st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes Trademark edit In Canada and many other countries Aspirin remains a trademark so generic aspirin is sold as ASA acetylsalicylic acid In the US aspirin is a generic name Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States in actions taken between and because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of Aspirin by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights Today aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries Aspirin with a capital A remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany Canada Mexico and in over other countries for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets but using different packaging and physical aspects for each Compendial status edit United States Pharmacopeia British Pharmacopoeia Medical use edit Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions including fever pain rheumatic fever and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis pericarditis and Kawasaki disease Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy There is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear In the United States the selective initiation of low dose aspirin based on an individualised assessment has been deemed reasonable for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people aged between and who have a or greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next years and are not at an increased risk of bleeding Pain edit Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps bloating gastric distension or acute skin irritation As with other NSAIDs combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone Effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain Aspirin either by itself or in a combined formulation effectively treats certain types of a headache but its efficacy may be questionable for others Secondary headaches meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma should be promptly treated by a medical provider Among primary headaches the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache the most common migraine and cluster headache Aspirin or other over the counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches Aspirin especially as a component of an aspirin paracetamol caffeine combination is considered a first line therapy in the treatment of migraine and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning Fever edit Like its ability to control pain aspirin s ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of COX Although aspirin s use as an antipyretic in adults is well established many medical societies and regulatory agencies including the American Academy of Family Physicians the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of Reye s syndrome a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection Because of the risk of Reye s syndrome in children in the US Food and Drug Administration FDA required labeling on all aspirin containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers Inflammation edit Aspirin is used as an anti inflammatory agent for both acute and long term inflammation as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis Heart attacks and strokes edit Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack It is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems including those over the age of The Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration published in Lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention In those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction daily low dose aspirin was associated with a relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events non fatal myocardial infarction non fatal stroke or vascular death This did come at the expense of a absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding however the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case citation needed Data from previous trials have suggested that weight based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes However more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight kg in specific subset of population studied i e elderly and diabetic population and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight kg After percutaneous coronary interventions PCIs such as the placement of a coronary artery stent a U S Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely Frequently aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor such as clopidogrel prasugrel or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots This is called dual antiplatelet therapy DAPT Duration of DAPT was advised in the United States and European Union guidelines after the CURE and PRODIGY studies In the systematic review and network meta analysis from Khan et al showed promising benefits of short term months DAPT followed by P Y inhibitors in selected patients as well as the benefits of extended term months DAPT in high risk patients In conclusion the optimal duration of DAPT after PCIs should be personalized after outweighing each patient s risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient related and procedure related factors Moreover aspirin should be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete The status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies The ASCEND study demonstrated that in high bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease there is no overall clinical benefit decrease in risk of ischaemic events v s increase in GI bleeding of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of years Similarly the results of the ARRIVE study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance For people who are resistant aspirin s efficacy is reduced Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin As of April the United States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF determined that there was a small net benefit for patients aged with a or greater year cardiovascular disease CVD risk and no net benefit for patients aged over Determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes Their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age while the risk of bleeding while small increases with age particular for adults over and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding As a result the USPSTF suggests that people ages to who are at higher risk for CVD should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin people or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke Primary prevention guidelines from September made by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged with a higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD without an increased bleeding risk while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk They state a CVD risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin while stating aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD because of lack of net benefit As of August the European Society of Cardiology made similar recommendations considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than at high or very high CVD risk without any clear contraindications on a case by case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk Cancer prevention edit Aspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer There is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer CRC but aspirin must be taken for at least years to see this benefit It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk Given this uncertainty the United States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk Nine years later however the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low dose aspirin to mg day for the primary prevention of CVD cardiovascular disease and CRC in adults to years of age who have a or greater year CVD risk are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least years and are willing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least years A meta analysis through said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum esophagus and stomach In the U S Preventive services Task Force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention It notes the results of the ASPREE Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly Trial in which the risk of cancer related death was higher in the aspirin treated group than in the placebo group Psychiatry edit Bipolar disorder edit Aspirin along with several other agents with anti inflammatory properties has been repurposed as an add on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders A systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies HR CI P However further high quality longer duration double blind randomized controlled trials RCTs are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add on treatment for bipolar depression Thus notwithstanding the biological rationale the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain Dementia edit Although cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this Schizophrenia edit Some researchers have speculated the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia Small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking Other uses edit Aspirin is a first line treatment for the fever and joint pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks and is rarely indicated for longer periods After fever and pain have subsided the aspirin is no longer necessary since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease Naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic but due to the limited clinical experience naproxen is recommended only as a second line treatment Along with rheumatic fever Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness Low dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre eclampsia This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy Aspirin has also demonstrated anti tumoral effects via inhibition of the PTTG gene which is often overexpressed in tumors Resistance edit See also Drug tolerance For some people aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men and a different aggregate study of people found were resistant A study in Italian people found of the apparent aspirin resistant subjects only were truly resistant and the others were noncompliant Another study of healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant but some had pseudoresistance reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption Meta analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases Although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis Aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis the sequalae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty Some of these risk factors include obesity advancing age diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia and inflammatory diseases Dosages edit Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes which vary slightly from country to country for example mg in Britain and mg or grains in the United States Smaller doses are based on these standards e g mg and mg tablets The milligram grain tablets are commonly called baby aspirin or baby strength because they were originally but no longer intended to be administered to infants and children No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the mg and the mg tablets The dose required for benefit appears to depend on a person s weight For those weighing less than kilograms lb low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease for patients above this weight higher doses are required In general for adults doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever For the prevention of myocardial infarction MI in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease much lower doses are taken once daily March recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged and women aged to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage needs update The WHI study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death from any cause though there was no significant difference between mg and mg aspirin doses The ADAPTABLE study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between mg and mg doses of aspirin in patients both men and women with established cardiovascular disease Low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events and lower aspirin doses or mg day may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long term prevention In children with Kawasaki disease aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks Adverse effects edit In October the US Food and Drug Administration FDA required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at weeks or later in pregnancy One exception to the recommendation is the use of low dose mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional Contraindications edit Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID precipitated bronchospasm Owing to its effect on the stomach lining manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers mild diabetes or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin Even if none of these conditions is present the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency Aspirin taken at doses of mg and mg per day for days can increase the odds of suffering a gout attack by and respectively This effect may potentially be worsened by high purine diets diuretics and kidney disease but is eliminated by the urate lowering drug allopurinol Daily low dose aspirin does not appear to worsen kidney function Aspirin may reduce cardiovascular risk in those without established cardiovascular disease in people with moderate CKD without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under the age of to control cold or influenza symptoms as this has been linked with Reye s syndrome Gastrointestinal edit Aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding Although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being gentle to the stomach in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk the Mayo Clinic agree with this and report that coated aspirin may also not be as effective at reducing blood clot risk Although enteric coated aspirin is said to be not as effective as plain aspirin in reducing blood clot risk however with the current available results from clinical studies there is still insufficient data to support this statement Larger studies are required to provide more accurate results and conclusions Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has been shown to further increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding Blockade of COX by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX as part of a gastric defense Several trials suggest that the simultaneous use of a COX inhibitor with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury However currently available evidence has been unable to prove that this effect is consistently repeatable in everyday clinical practice More dedicated research is required to provide greater clarity on the subject Therefore caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any natural supplements with COX inhibiting properties such as garlic extracts curcumin bilberry pine bark ginkgo fish oil resveratrol genistein quercetin resorcinol and others citation needed Buffering is an additional method that is used with the intention of mitigating gastrointestinal bleeding Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed citation needed Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used Bufferin for example uses magnesium oxide Other preparations use calcium carbonate Gas forming agents in effervescent tablet and powder formulations can also double as a buffering agent one example being sodium bicarbonate used in Alka Seltzer Taking vitamin C with aspirin has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining In trials vitamin C releasing aspirin ASA VitC or a buffered aspirin formulation containing vitamin C was found to cause less stomach damage than aspirin alone Retinal vein occlusion edit It is a widespread habit among eye specialists ophthalmologists to prescribe aspirin as an add on medication for patients with retinal vein occlusion RVO such as central retinal vein occlusion CRVO and branch retinal vein occlusion BRVO The reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion However a large scale investigation based on data of nearly patients showed that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with CRVO and hemi CRVO without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect Several expert groups including the Royal College of Ophthalmologists recommended against the use of antithrombotic drugs incl aspirin for patients with RVO Central effects edit Large doses of salicylate a metabolite of aspirin cause temporary tinnitus ringing in the ears based on experiments in rats via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade Reye s syndrome edit Main article Reye s syndrome Reye s syndrome a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection From to cases of Reye s syndrome in people younger than were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Of these reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye s syndrome most commonly with a respiratory infection chickenpox or diarrhea Salicylates were detectable in of children for whom test results were reported After the association between Reye s syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it including a Surgeon General s warning and changes to the labeling of aspirin containing drugs were implemented aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States as did the number of reported cases of Reye s syndrome a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued The US Food and Drug Administration recommends aspirin or aspirin containing products should not be given to anyone under the age of who has a fever and the UK National Health Service recommends children who are under years of age should not take aspirin unless it is on the advice of a doctor Skin edit For a small number of people taking aspirin can result in symptoms including hives swelling and headache Aspirin can exacerbate symptoms among those with chronic hives or create acute symptoms of hives These responses can be due to allergic reactions to aspirin or more often due to its effect of inhibiting the COX enzyme Skin reactions may also tie to systemic contraindications seen with NSAID precipitated bronchospasm or those with atopy Aspirin and other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may delay the healing of skin wounds Earlier findings from two small low quality trials suggested a benefit with aspirin alongside compression therapy on venous leg ulcer healing time and leg ulcer size however larger more recent studies of higher quality have been unable to corroborate these outcomes As such further research is required to clarify the role of aspirin in this context Other adverse effects edit Aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people In one study angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people However when the aspirin was taken alone it did not cause angioedema in these people the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID induced drug when angioedema appeared Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of to mm or smaller hypointense dark holes patches A study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage ICH of events per persons In comparison the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was events per persons and a reduction of events per persons in ischemic stroke In cases where ICH already has occurred aspirin use results in higher mortality with a dose of about mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH around confidence interval to Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis however these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state Use of low dose aspirin before a surgical procedure has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events in some patients however ceasing aspirin prior to surgery has also been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events An analysis of multiple studies found a three fold increase in adverse events such as myocardial infarction in patients who ceased aspirin prior to surgery The analysis found that the risk is dependent on the type of surgery being performed and the patient indication for aspirin use On July the US Food and Drug Administration FDA toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAID Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings Overdose edit Main article Aspirin poisoning Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic In acute poisoning a single large dose is taken in chronic poisoning higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time Acute overdose has a mortality rate of Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of chronic overdose may be especially severe in children Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments including activated charcoal intravenous dextrose and normal saline sodium bicarbonate and dialysis The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate the active metabolite of aspirin by automated spectrophotometric methods Plasma salicylate levels in general range from to mg L after usual therapeutic doses mg L in people taking high doses and mg L following acute overdose Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate methyl salicylate and sodium salicylate Interactions edit Aspirin is known to interact with other drugs For example acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide warfarin methotrexate phenytoin probenecid valproic acid as well as interfering with beta oxidation an important part of valproate metabolism and other NSAIDs Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin Other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin Although limited evidence suggests this may not result in a reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin Analgesic doses of aspirin decrease sodium loss induced by spironolactone in the urine however this does not reduce the antihypertensive effects of spironolactone Furthermore antiplatelet doses of aspirin are deemed too small to produce an interaction with spironolactone Aspirin is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C unreliable medical source Research edit The ISIS trial demonstrated that aspirin at doses of mg daily for one month decreased the mortality by of participants with a suspected myocardial infarction in the first five weeks A single daily dose of mg of aspirin for weeks has a highly protective effect against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina Bipolar disorder edit Aspirin has been repurposed as an add on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder However meta analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of bipolar depression Thus notwithstanding the biological rationale the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain Infectious diseases edit Several studies investigated the anti infective properties of aspirin for bacterial viral and parasitic infections Aspirin was demonstrated to limit platelet activation induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and to reduce streptococcal adhesion to heart valves In patients with tuberculous meningitis the addition of aspirin reduced the risk of new cerebral infarction RR A role of aspirin on bacterial and fungal biofilm is also being supported by growing evidence Cancer prevention edit Evidence from observational studies were conflicting on the effect of aspirin in breast cancer prevention a randomized controlled trial showed that aspirin had no significant effect in reducing breast cancer thus further studies are needed to clarify aspirin effect in cancer prevention In gardening edit There are a many anecdotal reportings that aspirin can improve plant s growth and resistance though most research involved salicylic acid instead of aspirin Veterinary medicine edit Aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis Aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian as adverse effects including gastrointestinal issues are common An aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning characterized by hemorrhaging seizures coma and even death Dogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are Cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given mg kg of aspirin every hours for weeks but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is mg kg every hours to allow for metabolization See also edit Medicine portal Fluoroaspirin References edit Aspirin Use During Pregnancy Drugs com April Retrieved December OTC medicine monograph Aspirin tablets for oral use

acetylsalicylic acid is a novel organic compound that does not occur in nature and was first successfully synthesised in In scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylated organic compounds as possible new medicines following the success of acetanilide ten years earlier By Bayer created acetylsalicylic acid and named the drug Aspirin going on to sell it around the world The word Aspirin was Bayer s brand name rather than the generic name of the drug however Bayer s rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries Aspirin s popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products Aspirin s popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen paracetamol in and ibuprofen in In the s and s John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin s effects while clinical trials and other studies from the s to the s established aspirin s efficacy as an anti clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century and remain strong in the twenty first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes History of willow in medicine edit Numerous authors have claimed that willow was used by the ancients as a painkiller but there is no evidence that this is true All such accounts date from after the discovery of aspirin and are possibly based on a misunderstanding of the chemistry Bartram s Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine is perhaps typical when it states in chemists identified salicylic acid in the bark of White Willow After many years it was synthesised as acetylsalicylic acid now known as aspirin It goes on to claim that willow extract has the same medical properties as aspirin which is incorrect Edward Stone believed that the bark of the white willow Salix alba could substitute for Peruvian bark in the treatment of ague Ancient medical uses for willow were more varied The Roman author Aulus Cornelius Celsus recommended using the leaves pounded and boiled in vinegar as treatment for uterine prolapse but it is unclear what he considered the therapeutic action to be it is unlikely to have been pain relief as he recommended cauterization in the following paragraph De Medicina book VI p chapter section Gerard quotes Dioscorides that the bark being burnt to ashes and steeped in vinegar takes away corns and other like risings in the feet and toes which is similar to modern uses of salicylic acid Translations of Hippocrates make no mention of willow at all Nicholas Culpeper in The Complete Herbal gave many uses for willow including to staunch wounds to stay the heat of lust in man or woman and to provoke urine if stopped but like Celsus made no mention of any analgesic properties He also used the burnt ashes of willow bark mixed with vinegar to take away warts corns and superfluous flesh Although Turner thought that fevers could be cured by cooling the air with boughs and leaves of willow the earliest known mention of willow bark extract for treating fever came in when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone to the Royal Society described the dramatic power of powdered white willow bark to cure intermittent fevers or ague Stone had accidentally tasted the bark of a willow tree in and noticed an astringency reminiscent of Peruvian bark which he knew was used to treat malaria Over the next five years he treated some ague sufferers with universal success except in a few severe cases where it merely reduced their symptoms Stone s remedy was trialled by a few pharmacists but was never widely adopted During the American Civil War Confederate forces experimented with willow as a cure for malaria without success Synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid edit In the th century as the young discipline of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe scientists attempted to isolate and purify alkaloids and other novel organic chemicals After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in Johann Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals from willow bark in the following year Pierre Joseph Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin In Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher extracted a substance from meadowsweet which he suggested might reveal an excellent therapeutic aspect although he was uninterested in increasing the number of chemicals available to pharmaceutical science By Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract which he named salicylic acid The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract Karl Jacob L wig soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found Meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria The first evidence that salicylates might have medical uses came in when the Scottish physician Thomas MacLagan experimented with salicin as a treatment for acute rheumatism with considerable success as he reported in The Lancet Meanwhile German scientists tried salicylic acid in the form of sodium salicylate with less success and more severe side effects The treatment of rheumatic fever with salicin gradually gained some acceptance in medical circles By the s the German chemical industry jump started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar derived medicines The turning point was the advent of Kalle Company s Antifebrine the branded version of acetanilide the fever reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in Antifebrine s success inspired Carl Duisberg the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer Company to start a systematic search for other useful drugs by acetylation of various alkaloids and aromatic compounds Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional Upon taking control of Bayer s overall management in Duisberg began to expand the company s drug research program He created a pharmaceutical group for creating new drugs headed by former university chemist Arthur Eichengr n and a pharmacology group for testing the drugs headed by Heinrich Dreser beginning in after periods under Wilhelm Siebel and Hermann Hildebrandt In the young chemist Felix Hoffmann joined the pharmaceutical group Dreser Eichengr n and Hoffmann would be the key figures in the development of acetylsalicylic acid as the drug Aspirin though their respective roles have been the subject of some contention In Hoffmann used salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride to synthesise acetylsalicylic acid Eichengr n sent the ASA to Dreser s pharmacology group for testing and the initial results were very positive The next step would normally have been clinical trials but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid s reputation for weakening the heart possibly a side effect of the high doses often used to treat rheumatism Dreser s group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann s next chemical success diacetylmorphine which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them Eichengr n frustrated by Dreser s rejection of ASA went directly to Bayer s Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low profile trials with doctors Though the results of those trials were also very positive with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications Dreser still demurred However Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing Soon Dreser admitted ASA s potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug in it he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengr n He would also be the only one of the three to receive royalties for the drug for testing it since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it For many years however he attributed Aspirin s discovery solely to Hoffmann The controversy over who was primarily responsible for aspirin s development spread through much of the twentieth century and into the twenty first As of Bayer still described Hoffman as having discovered a pain relieving fever lowering and anti inflammatory substance Historians and others have also challenged Bayer s early accounts of Bayer s synthesis in which Hoffmann was primarily responsible for the Bayer breakthrough In shortly before his death Eichengr n wrote an article Fifty Years of Aspirin claiming that he had not told Hoffmann the purpose of his research meaning that Hoffmann merely carried out Eichengr n s research plan and that the drug would never have gone to the market without his direction This claim was later supported by research conducted by historian Walter Sneader Axel Helmstaedter General Secretary of the International Society for the History of Pharmacy subsequently questioned the novelty of Sneader s research noting that several earlier articles discussed the Hoffmann Eichengr n controversy in detail Bayer countered Sneader in a press release stating that according to the records Hoffmann and Eichengr n held equal positions and Eichengr n was not Hoffmann s supervisor Hoffmann was named on the US Patent as the inventor which Sneader did not mention Eichengr n who left Bayer in had multiple opportunities to claim the priority and had never before done it he neither claimed nor received any percentage of the profit from aspirin sales Naming the drug edit Spirea ulmaria now known as Filipendula ulmaria or meadowsweet is the German namesake of Spirs ure salicylic acid and ultimately aspirin The name Aspirin was derived from the name of the chemical ASA Acetylspirs ure in German Spirs ure salicylic acid was named for the meadowsweet plant Spirea ulmaria from which it could be derived Aspirin took a for the acetylation spir from Spirs ure and added in as a typical drug name ending to make it easy to say In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer it came down to Aspirin and Euspirin Aspirin they feared might remind customers of aspiration but Arthur Eichengr n argued that Eu meaning good was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug Since the substance itself was already known Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new in January they settled on Aspirin Rights and sale edit Under Carl Duisberg s leadership Bayer was firmly committed to the standards of ethical drugs as opposed to patent medicines Ethical drugs were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist usually with a doctor s prescription Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations that was the domain of patent medicines Therefore Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors When production of Aspirin began in Bayer sent out small packets of the drug to doctors pharmacists and hospitals advising them of Aspirin s uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug s effects and effectiveness As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible It was ineligible for patent in Germany despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned but Aspirin was patented in Britain filed December and the United States US Patent issued February The British patent was overturned in the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld Faced with growing legal and illegal competition for the globally marketed ASA Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo In the company set up an American subsidiary with a converted factory in Rensselaer New York to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers The company s attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association especially after the Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin World War I and Bayer edit By the outbreak of World War I in Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers as well as other German drug firms particularly Heyden and Hoechst The British market was immediately closed to the German companies but British manufacturing could not meet the demand especially with phenol supplies necessary for ASA synthesis largely being used for explosives manufacture On February Bayer s UK trademarks were voided so that any company could use the term aspirin The Australian market was taken over by Aspro after the makers of Nicholas Aspirin lost a short lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there In the United States Bayer was still under German control though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy Great Phenol Plot edit Main article Great Phenol Plot The edition of August of the New York World broke the news of the Great Phenol Plot and other clandestine pro German activities that were organized by Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Heinrich Alberts To secure phenol for aspirin production and at the same time indirectly aid the German war effort German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great Phenol Plot By the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer s aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new branding strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States Thomas Edison who needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records was also facing supply problems in response he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day Edison s excess phenol seemed destined for trinitrophenol production Although the United States remained officially neutral until April it was increasingly throwing its support to the Allies through trade To counter this German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany One of their agents was a former Bayer employee Hugo Schweitzer Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison s excess phenol Much of the phenol would go to the German owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden s American subsidiary Heyden was the supplier of Bayer s salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture By July Edison s plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer Heyden s salicylic acid production was soon back on line and in turn Bayer s aspirin plant was running as well The plot only lasted a few months On July Heinrich Albert s briefcase containing details about the phenol plot was recovered by a Secret Service agent Although the activities were not illegal since the United States was still officially neutral and still trading with Germany the documents were soon leaked to the New York World an anti German newspaper The World published an expos on August The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U S military but by that time the deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer s Aspirin plant running Bayer s reputation took a large hit however just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand Bayer loses foreign holdings edit Beginning in Bayer set up a number of shell corporations and subsidiaries in the United States to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U S should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets e g army uniforms After the U S declared war on Germany in April alien property custodian A Mitchell Palmer began investigating German owned businesses and soon turned his attention to Bayer To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government Bayer s management shifted the stock to a new company nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German American Bayer leaders Palmer however soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer s American holdings After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer s American patents and trademarks including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo It was bought by a patent medicine company Sterling Products Inc The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U S rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in for US billion Interwar years edit Bayer began advertising directly to American consumers just before the expiration of the aspirin patent This ad from The New York Times February emphasizes Bayer as the One Real Aspirin in anticipation of legal competition in the American market With the coming of the deadly Spanish flu pandemic in aspirin by whatever name secured a reputation as one of the most powerful and effective drugs in the pharmacopeia of the time Its fever reducing properties gave many sick patients enough strength to fight through the infection and aspirin companies large and small earned the loyalty of doctors and the public when they could manufacture or purchase enough aspirin to meet demand Despite this some people believed that Germans put the Spanish flu bug in Bayer aspirin causing the pandemic as a war tactic Newspaper ad for Bayer Aspirin from April The aspirin patent had expired Bayer still had control over the Aspirin trademark seen at the bottom of the ad and a patriotic slogan to buy war bonds Also shows the factory in New York State The U S ASA patent expired in but Sterling owned the aspirin trademark which was the only commonly used term for the drug In United Drug Company challenged the Aspirin trademark which became officially generic for public sale in the U S although it remained trademarked when sold to wholesalers and pharmacists With demand growing rapidly in the wake of the Spanish flu there were soon hundreds of aspirin brands on sale in the United States Sterling Products equipped with all of Bayer s U S intellectual property tried to take advantage of its new brand as quickly as possible before generic ASAs took over However without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals they had only a finite aspirin supply and were facing competition from other companies Sterling president William E Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin not only in the U S but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well Taking advantage of the losses Farbenfabriken Bayer the German Bayer company suffered through the reparation provisions of the Treaty of Versailles Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share profits in the Americas Australia South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs Sterling also took over Bayer s Canadian assets as well as ownership of the Aspirin trademark which is still valid in Canada and most of the world Bayer bought Sterling Winthrop in restoring ownership of the Bayer name and Bayer cross trademark in the US and Canada as well as ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada Diversification of market edit Aspro packaging Between World War I and World War II many new aspirin brands and aspirin based products entered the market The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies built Aspro into a global brand with particular strength in Australia New Zealand and the U K American brands such as Burton s Aspirin Molloy s Aspirin Cal Aspirin and St Joseph Aspirin tried to compete with the American Bayer while new products such Cafaspirin aspirin with caffeine and Alka Seltzer a soluble mix of aspirin and bicarbonate of soda put aspirin to new uses In the German Bayer became part of IG Farben a conglomerate of former dye companies IG Farben s brands of Aspirin and in Latin America the caffeinated Cafiaspirina co managed with Sterling Products competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol Competition from new drugs edit After World War II with the IG Farben conglomerate dismantled because of its central role in the Nazi regime Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd the British Bayer subsidiary the other half of which it already owned However Bayer Aspirin made up only a small fraction of the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro Disprin a soluble aspirin drug and other brands Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin Anadin and Excedrin Bayer Ltd s manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had in found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide acetaminophen After clinical trials Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in However Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States or other countries where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs most significantly McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in and Tylenol pills in By Tylenol was available without a prescription Because it did not cause gastric irritation acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin s sales Another analgesic anti inflammatory drug was introduced in ibuprofen sold as Brufen in the U K and Motrin in the U S By the s aspirin had a relatively small portion of the pain reliever market and in the s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription Also in the early s several studies suggested a link between children s consumption of aspirin and Reye s syndrome a potentially fatal disease By the U S Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin further suppressing sales The makers of Tylenol also filed a lawsuit against Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products claiming that the failure to add warning labels before had unfairly held back Tylenol sales though this suit was eventually dismissed Investigating how aspirin works edit See also Mechanism of action of aspirin The mechanism of aspirin s analgesic anti inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug s heyday in the early to mid twentieth century Heinrich Dreser s explanation widely accepted since the drug was first brought to market was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system In Harry Collier a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis began investigating the relationship between kinins and the effects of aspirin In tests on guinea pigs Collier found that aspirin if given beforehand inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin He found that cutting the guinea pigs vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation rather than on the central nervous system In Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise mechanism of aspirin s effects However it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings on in live research animals and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests After five years of collaboration Collier arranged for Piper to work with pharmacologist John Vane at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in order to learn Vane s new bioassay methods which seemed like a possible solution to the in vitro testing failures Vane and Piper tested the biochemical cascade associated with anaphylactic shock in extracts from guinea pig lungs applied to tissue from rabbit aortas They found that aspirin inhibited the release of an unidentified chemical generated by guinea pig lungs a chemical that caused rabbit tissue to contract By Vane identified the chemical which they called rabbit aorta contracting substance or RCS as a prostaglandin In a June paper in the journal Nature Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins Later research showed that NSAIDs such as aspirin worked by inhibiting cyclooxygenase the enzyme responsible for converting arachidonic acid into a prostaglandin Revival as heart drug edit Aspirin s effects on blood clotting as an antiplatelet agent were first noticed in by Lawrence Craven Craven a family doctor in California had been directing tonsillectomy patients to chew Aspergum an aspirin laced chewing gum He found that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized for severe bleeding and that those patients had been using very high amounts of Aspergum Craven began recommending daily aspirin to all his patients and claimed that the patients who followed the aspirin regimen about people had no signs of thrombosis However Craven s studies were not taken seriously by the medical community because he had not done a placebo controlled study and had published only in obscure journals The idea of using aspirin to prevent clotting diseases such as heart attacks and strokes was revived in the s when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti adhesive effect on blood platelets and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs aspirin had low toxicity Medical Research Council haematologist John O Brien picked up on Weiss s finding and in began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin s anti thrombosis drug potential Elwood began a large scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double blind controlled study heart attack survivors were statistically more likely to suffer a second attack greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks The study began in February though the researchers soon had to break the double blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly Jick had found that fewer aspirin takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non aspirin takers and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital Elwood s initial results ruled out that explanation When the Elwood trial ended in it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin Several subsequent studies put aspirin s effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground but the evidence was not incontrovertible However in the mid s with the relatively new technique of meta analysis statistician Richard Peto convinced the U S FDA and much of the medical community that the aspirin studies in aggregate showed aspirin s effectiveness with relative certainty By the end of the s aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top selling analgesic in the U S In three major clinical trials cast doubt on that conventional wisdom finding few benefits and consistent bleeding risks associated with daily aspirin use Taken together the findings led the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology to change clinical practice guidelines in early recommending against the routine use of aspirin in people older than years or people with increased bleeding risk who do not have existing

inflammation analgesia relief of pain the prevention of clotting and the reduction of fever Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA Aspirin s ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase COX enzyme Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen which are reversible inhibitors However other effects of aspirin such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and the modulation of signaling through NF B are also being investigated Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid which is not an acetylating agent Effects on cyclooxygenase edit See also Cyclooxygenase This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section Unsourced material may be challenged and removed June Learn how and when to remove this template message Structure of COX inactivated by Aspirin In the active site of each of the two enzymes Serine has been acetylated Also visible is the salicylic acid which has transferred the acetyl group and the heme cofactor There are at least two different cyclooxygenase isozymes COX PTGS and COX PTGS Aspirin is non selective and irreversibly inhibits both forms better source needed but is weakly more selective for COX It does so by acetylating the hydroxyl of a serine residue Normally COX produces prostaglandins most of which are pro inflammatory and thromboxanes which promote clotting Aspirin modified COX produces lipoxins most of which are anti inflammatory citation needed Newer NSAID drugs called COX selective inhibitors have been developed that inhibit only COX with the hope for reduction of gastrointestinal side effects However several COX selective inhibitors have subsequently been withdrawn after evidence emerged that COX inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack e g see the article on Vioxx citation needed The underlying mechanism for the deleterious effect proposes that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body express COX whose selective inhibition results in levels of prostaglandin I PGI prostacyclin down regulated relative to thromboxane since COX in platelets is unaffected citation needed Thus the protective anti coagulative effect of PGI is decreased increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems citation needed As platelets have no DNA they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference between aspirin and the reversible inhibitors clarification needed citation needed Effects on prostaglandins and thromboxanes edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section Unsourced material may be challenged and removed June Learn how and when to remove this template message Prostaglandins are local chemical messengers that exert multiple effects including but not limited to the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat and inflammation They are produced in response to the stimulation of phospholipids within the plasma membrane of cells resulting in the release of arachidonic acid prostaglandin precursor Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots citation needed Low dose long term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation This antiplatelet property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots and their reduction with the introduction of small amounts of aspirin has been seen to be an effective medical intervention citation needed A dose of mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin I synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition A side effect of aspirin mechanism is that the ability of the blood in general to clot is reduced and excessive bleeding may result from the use of aspirin Other methods of action edit Aspirin has been shown to have three additional modes of action It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous and hepatic mitochondria by diffusing from the intermembrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons In short aspirin buffers and transports the protons acting as a competitor to ATP synthase When high doses of aspirin are given aspirin may actually cause hyperthermia due to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses Additionally aspirin induces the formation of NO radicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation This reduces leukocyte adhesion which is an important step in immune response to infection There is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection More recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF B NF B is a transcription factor complex that plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation Reye s syndrome edit See also Reye s syndrome Reye s syndrome is a potentially fatal disease that causes numerous detrimental effects to many organs especially the brain and liver as well as causing hypoglycemia The exact cause is unknown and while it has been associated with aspirin consumption by children with viral illness it also occurs in the absence of aspirin use The disease causes fatty liver with minimal inflammation and severe encephalopathy with swelling of the brain The liver may become slightly enlarged and firm and there is a change in the appearance of the kidneys Jaundice is not usually present Early diagnosis is vital while most children recover with supportive therapy severe brain injury or death are potential complications See also edit History of aspirin References

            " Hyoscine butylbromide a review of its use in the treatment of abdominal cramping and pain Drugs doi Author Guido N Tytgat Affiliation Academisch Medisch Centrum Amsterdam The Netherlands g n tytgat amc uva nl PMID DOI Abstract Abdominal cramping and pain is a frequent problem in the adult population of Western countries with an estimated prevalence of or Hyoscine butylbromide scopolamine butylbromide Buscopan Buscapina is an antispasmodic drug indicated for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with cramps induced by gastrointestinal GI spasms It was first registered in Germany in and marketed in and has since become available worldwide both as a prescription drug and as an over the counter medicine in many countries This article reviews the pharmacology and pharmacokinetic profile of hyoscine butylbromide and summarises efficacy and safety data from clinical trials of this drug for abdominal cramping and pain Pharmacological studies have revealed that hyoscine butylbromide is an anticholinergic drug with high affinity for muscarinic receptors located on the smooth muscle cells of the GI tract Its anticholinergic action exerts a smooth muscle relaxing spasmolytic effect Blockade of the muscarinic receptors in the GI tract is the basis for its use in the treatment of abdominal pain secondary to cramping Hyoscine butylbromide also binds to nicotinic receptors which induces a ganglion blocking effect Several pharmacokinetic studies in humans have consistently demonstrated the low systemic availability of hyoscine butylbromide after oral administration with plasma concentrations of the drug generally being below the limit of quantitation The bioavailability of hyoscine butylbromide estimated from renal excretion was generally However because of its high tissue affinity for muscarinic receptors hyoscine butylbromide remains available at the site of action in the intestine and exerts a local spasmolytic effect Ten placebo controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral or rectal hyoscine butylbromide Hyoscine butylbromide was considered beneficial in all of these trials which supports its use in the treatment of abdominal pain caused by cramping Hyoscine butylbromide is barely absorbed and detectable in the blood and does not penetrate the blood brain barrier and is therefore generally well tolerated Few adverse events have been reported in particular no significant increases in the incidence of anticholinergic related adverse effects have been observed In summary hyoscine butylbromide appears to be a valuable treatment option for patients with symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with cramping Publication types Research Support Non U S Gov t Review MeSH terms Animals Butylscopolammonium Bromide adverse effects Butylscopolammonium Bromide chemistry Butylscopolammonium Bromide therapeutic use Clinical Trials as Topic Colic drug therapy Humans Molecular Structure Muscarinic Antagonists adverse effects Muscarinic Antagonists therapeutic use Parasympatholytics adverse effects Parasympatholytics therapeutic use Treatment Outcome Substances Muscarinic Antagonists Parasympatholytics Butylscopolammonium Bromide\n",

Ramipril mg RAMIPRES Tablets Each tablet contains Ramipril mg Dosage Form s and Strength s Tablet containing mg mg mg and mg of ramipril Clinical Particulars Therapeutic Indications Hypertension RAMIPRES is indicated for the treatment of hypertension It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics In using Ramipril consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has caused agranulocytosis particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease Available data are insufficient to show that Ramipril does not have a similar risk In considering use of Ramipril it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non blacks In addition ACE inhibitors for which adequate data are available cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non black patients Reduction in Risk of Myocardial Infarction Stroke and Death from Cardiovascular Causes RAMIPRES is indicated in patients years or older at high risk of developing a major cardiovascular event because of a history of coronary artery disease stroke peripheral vascular disease or diabetes that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor hypertension elevated total cholesterol levels low HDL levels cigarette smoking or documented microalbuminuria to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction stroke or death from cardiovascular causes Ramipril can be used in addition to other needed treatment such as antihypertensive antiplatelet or lipid lowering therapy Heart Failure Post myocardial Infarction RAMIPRES is indicated in stable patients who have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure within the first few days after sustaining acute myocardial infarction Administration of ramipril to such patients has been shown to decrease the risk of death principally cardiovascular death and to decrease the risks of failure related hospitalization and progression to severe resistant heart failure Posology and Method of Administration Blood pressure decreases associated with any dose of ramipril depend in part on the presence or absence of volume depletion e g past and current diuretic use or the presence or absence of renal artery stenosis If such circumstances are suspected to be present the initial starting dose should be mg once daily Hypertension The recommended initial dose for patients to be treated for hypertension not receiving a diuretic is mg once a day Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response The usual maintenance dosage range is to mg day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses In some patients treated once daily the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval In such patients consider an increase in dosage or twice daily administration If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone a diuretic can be added Reduction in Risk of Myocardial Infarction Stroke and Death from Cardiovascular Causes RAMIPRES should be given at an initial dose of mg once a day for week mg once a day for the next weeks and then increased as tolerated to a maintenance dose of mg once daily If the patient is hypertensive or recently post myocardial infarction it can be given as a divided dose Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction For the treatment of post myocardial infarction patients who have shown signs of congestive heart failure the recommended starting dose is RAMIPRES twice daily mg daily A patient who becomes hypotensive at this dose may be switched to RAMIPRES twice daily After one week at the starting dose patients should be titrated if tolerated toward a target dose of mg twice daily with dosage increases being about weeks apart After the initial dose of RAMIPRES the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour If possible the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced as this may diminish the likelihood of hypotension The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of RAMIPRES does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug following effective management of the hypotension The RAMIPRES tablet is usually swallowed whole Concomitant administration of RAMIPRES with potassium supplements potassium salt substitutes or potassium sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of RAMIPRES To reduce the likelihood of hypotension the diuretic should if possible be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with RAMIPRES Then if blood pressure is not controlled with RAMIPRES alone diuretic therapy should be resumed If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of mg Ramipril should be used to avoid excess hypotension Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance mL min m serum creatinine approximately mg dL doses only of those normally used should be expected to induce full therapeutic levels of ramiprilat Hypertension For patients with hypertension and renal impairment the recommended initial dose is RAMIPRES once daily Dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum total daily dose of mg Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction For patients with heart failure and renal impairment the recommended initial dose is RAMIPRES once daily The dose may be increased to mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of mg twice daily depending on clinical response and tolerability Contraindications Ramipril tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product or any other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor e g a patient who has experienced angioedema during therapy with any other ACE inhibitor Special Warnings and Precautions for Use Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because drugs that act directly on the RAAS e g ACE inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides including endogenous bradykinin patients receiving these drugs including ramipril may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions some of them serious Head and Neck Angioedema Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor Angioedema of the face extremities lips tongue glottis and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face tongue or glottis occurs discontinue treatment with ramipril and institute appropriate therapy immediately Where there is involvement of the tongue glottis or larynx likely to cause airway obstruction administer appropriate therapy e g subcutaneous epinephrine solution should be promptly administered Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors These patients presented with abdominal pain with or without nausea or vomiting in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C esterase levels were normal The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound or at surgery and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor Include intestinal angioedema in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain In a large U S post marketing study angioedema defined as reports of angio face larynx tongue or throat edema was reported in Black patients and in of white patients These rates were not different statistically Anaphylactoid Reactions during Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life threatening anaphylactoid reactions In the same patients these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge Anaphylactoid Reactions during Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption Hypotension Ramipril can cause symptomatic hypotension after either the initial dose or a later dose when the dosage has been increased Ramipril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy dietary salt restriction dialysis diarrhea or vomiting Volume and or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with Ramipril In patients with congestive heart failure with or without associated renal insufficiency ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and death In such patients Ramipril therapy should be started under close medical supervision they should be followed closely for the first weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ramipril or diuretic is increased If hypotension occurs the patient should be placed in a supine position and if necessary treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline Ramipril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume Hepatic Failure Rarely ACE inhibitors including Ramipril have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow up Hyponatremia Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone SIADH and subsequent hyponatremia has been observed in some patients treated with ramipril It is recommended that serum sodium levels be monitored regularly in the elderly and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis As with other ACE inhibitors rarely a mild in isolated cases severe reduction in the red blood cell count and hemoglobin content white blood cell or platelet count may develop In isolated cases agranulocytosis pancytopenia and bone marrow depression may occur Hematological reactions to ACE inhibitors are more likely to occur in patients with collagen vascular disease e g systemic lupus erythematosus scleroderma and renal impairment Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen vascular disease especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia anuria hypotension renal failure and death When pregnancy is detected discontinue Ramipril as soon as possible These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system for a particular patient apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra amniotic environment If oligohydramnios is observed discontinue Ramipril unless it is considered life saving for the mother Fetal testing may be appropriate based on the week of pregnancy Patients and physicians should be aware however that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Ramipril for hypotension oliguria and hyperkalemia No teratogenic effects of Ramipril ramipril were seen in studies of pregnant rats rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys On a body surface area basis the doses used were up to approximately times in rats and monkeys and times in rabbits the recommended human dose Congestive Heart Failure In patients with congestive heart failure with or without associated renal insufficiency ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and death In such patients ramipril therapy should be started under close medical supervision and follow the patients closely for the first weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ramipril or diuretic is increased Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction In patients with heart failure post myocardial infarction who are currently being treated with a diuretic symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of ramipril If the initial dose of mg ramipril cannot be tolerated use an initial dose of mg ramipril to avoid excessive hypotension Consider reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic to decrease the incidence of hypotension Surgery and Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension ramipril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion Ramipril should be discontinued where possible one day before surgery Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin angiotensin aldosterone system changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors including Ramipril may be associated with oliguria and or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and or death In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of Ramipril and or diuretic therapy In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine usually minor and transient especially when Ramipril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic This is more likely to occur in patients with pre existing renal impairment Dosage reduction of Ramipril and or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required Hyperkalemia In clinical trials with ramipril hyperkalemia serum potassium mEq L occurred in approximately of hypertensive patients receiving ramipril In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use potassium sparing diuretics potassium supplements and or potassium containing salt substitutes which should be used cautiously if at all with Ramipril Cough Presumably caused by inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin persistent non productive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors always resolving after discontinuation of therapy Consider the possibility of ACE inhibitor induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough Impaired Liver Function Since ramipril is primarily metabolized by hepatic esterases to its active moiety ramiprilat patients with impaired liver function could develop markedly elevated plasma levels of ramipril No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in hypertensive patients with impaired liver function However since the renin angiotensin system may be activated in patients with severe liver cirrhosis and or ascites particular caution should be exercised in treating these patients Surgery Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension ramipril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion Dual Blockade of the Renin Angiotensin System RAAS Telmisartan The ONTARGET trial enrolled patients years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end organ damage randomized them to telmisartan only ramipril only or the combination and followed them for a median of months Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any benefit in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death MI stroke and heart failure hospitalization compared to monotherapy but experienced an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction death doubling of serum creatinine or dialysis compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone Concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended Drug Interactions Nonsteroidal Anti inflammatory Agents NSAIDs Including Selective Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors COX inhibitors In patients who are elderly volume depleted including those on diuretic therapy or with compromised renal function co administration of NSAIDs including selective COX inhibitors with ACE inhibitors including ramipril may result in deterioration of renal function including possible acute renal failure These effects are usually reversible Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving ramipril and NSAID therapy The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors including ramipril may be attenuated by NSAIDs Diuretics Patients on diuretics especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with ramipril The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with ramipril If this is not possible reduce the starting dose Antihypertensive Agents and Other Substances that may Decrease Blood Pressure Co administration of ramipril with antihypertensive agents e g diuretics or with substances that may decrease blood pressure e g nitrates tricyclic antidepressants anesthetics acute alcohol intake baclofen alfuzosin doxazosin prazosin tamsulosin terazosin may potentiate the risk of hypotension Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of ramipril with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia Monitor serum potassium in such patients Other Agents Affecting RAAS In general avoid combined use of RAAS inhibitors Do not co administer aliskiren with ramipril in patients with diabetes With Potassium Supplements and Potassium sparing Diuretics Ramipril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics Potassium sparing diuretics spironolactone amiloride triamterene and others or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia Therefore if concomitant use of such agents is indicated they should be given with caution and the patient s serum potassium should be monitored frequently Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium therefore frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended If a diuretic is also used the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased Gold Nitritoid reactions symptoms include facial flushing nausea vomiting and hypotension have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold sodium aurothiomalate and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including ramipril Other Neither Ramipril nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food digoxin antacid furosemide cimetidine indomethacin and simvastatin The combination of Ramipril and propranolol showed no adverse effects on dynamic parameters blood pressure and heart rate The co administration of Ramipril and warfarin did not adversely affect the anticoagulant effects of the latter drug Additionally co administration of Ramipril with phenprocoumon did not affect minimum phenprocoumon levels or interfere with the subjects state of anti coagulation Use in Special Population Patients with Renal Impairment As a consequence of inhibiting the RAAS changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the RAAS treatment with ACE inhibitors including ramipril may be associated with oliguria and or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and or death In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur Experience with another ACE inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ramipril and or diuretic therapy In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine usually minor and transient especially when ramipril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic This is more likely to occur in patients with pre existing renal impairment Dosage reduction of ramipril and or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required A single dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in hypertensive patients with varying degrees of renal impairment who received a single mg dose of ramipril Patients were stratified into four groups based on initial estimates of creatinine clearance normal mL min mild impairment mL min moderate impairment mL min and severe impairment mL min On average the AUC h for ramiprilat was approximately fold higher fold higher and fold higher in the groups with mild moderate and severe renal impairment respectively compared to the group with normal renal function Overall the results suggest that the starting dose of ramipril should be adjusted downward in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment Patients with Hepatic Impairment Rarely ACE inhibitors including ramipril have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood Discontinue ramipril if patient develops jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes As ramipril is primarily metabolized by hepatic esterases to its active moiety ramiprilat patients with impaired liver function could develop markedly elevated plasma levels of ramipril No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in hypertensive patients with impaired liver function Lactating Women Ingestion of a single mg oral dose of ramipril resulted in undetectable amounts of ramipril and its metabolites in breast milk However because multiple doses may produce low milk concentrations that are not predictable from a single dose do not use ramipril in nursing mothers Paediatric Patients Neonates with a History of in utero Exposure to Ramipril If oliguria or hypotension occurs direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and or substituting for disordered renal function Ramipril which crosses the placenta can be removed from the neonatal circulation by these means but limited experience has not shown that such removal is central to the treatment of these infants Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established Irreversible kidney damage has been observed in very young rats given a single dose of ramipril Geriatric Patients Of the total number of patients who received ramipril in U S clinical studies of ramipril were years of age while were years of age No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out One pharmacokinetic study conducted in hospitalized elderly patients indicated that peak ramiprilat levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve AUC for ramiprilat are higher in older patients Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines You may feel dizzy while taking RAMIPRES tablets This is more likely to happen when you start taking RAMIPRES tablets or start taking a higher dose If this happens do not drive or use any tools or machines Undesirable Effects Hypertension Ramipril has been evaluated for safety in over patients with hypertension of these patients were studied in U S controlled trials and were studied in foreign controlled trials Almost of these patients were treated for at least one year The overall incidence of reported adverse events was similar in ramipril and placebo patients The most frequent clinical side effects possibly or probably related to study drug reported by patients receiving ramipril in placebo controlled trials were headache dizziness and fatigue or asthenia but only the last one was more common in ramipril patients than in patients given placebo Generally the side effects were mild and transient and there was no relation to total dosage within the range of mg mg Discontinuation of therapy because of a side effect was required in approximately of U S patients treated with ramipril The most common reasons for discontinuation were cough dizziness and impotence Of observed side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U S placebo controlled trials in more than of patients treated with ramipril only asthenia fatigue was more common on ramipril than placebo vs respectively Table Patients in US placebo controlled studies Placebo Ramipril N N n n Asthenia Fatigue In placebo controlled trials there was also an excess of upper respiratory infection and flu syndrome in the ramipril group not attributed at that time to ramipril As these studies were carried out before the relationship of cough to ACE inhibitors was recognized some of these events may represent ramipril induced cough In a later year study increased cough was seen in almost of ramipril patients with about of patients requiring discontinuation of treatment Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction Adverse reactions except laboratory abnormalities considered possibly probably related to study drug that occurred in more than of patients and more frequently on ramipril are shown below table The incidences are from the AIRE study The follow up time was between and months for this study Table Percentage of patients with adverse events possibly probably related to study drug placebo controlled AIRE mortality study Placebo Ramipril Adverse Event N N Hypotension Cough increased Dizziness Angina pectoris Nausea Postural hypotension Syncope Vomiting Vertigo Abnormal kidney function Diarrhea HOPE Study Safety data in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation HOPE study were collected as reasons for discontinuation or temporary interruption of treatment The incidence of cough was similar to that seen in the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy AIRE trial The rate of angioedema was the same as in previous clinical trials Table Reasons for discontinuation or temporary interruption of treatment HOPE study Placebo Ramipril N N Discontinuation at any time Permanent discontinuation Reasons for stopping Cough Hypotension or dizziness Angioedema Other Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in less than of ramipril patients or rarer events seen in post marketing experience include the following in some a causal relationship to drug is uncertain Body as a Whole Anaphylactoid reactions Cardiovascular Symptomatic hypotension reported in of patients in U S trials syncope and palpitations Hematologic Pancytopenia hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia Renal Acute renal failure Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre existing renal disease have developed minor usually transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine when taking ramipril particularly when ramipril was given concomitantly with a diuretic Angioneurotic Edema Angioneurotic edema has been reported in of patients in U S clinical trials of ramipril Gastrointestinal Hepatic failure hepatitis jaundice pancreatitis abdominal pain sometimes with enzyme changes suggesting pancreatitis anorexia constipation diarrhea dry mouth dyspepsia dysphagia gastroenteritis increased salivation taste disturbance Dermatologic Apparent hypersensitivity reactions manifested by urticaria pruritus or rash with or without fever photosensitivity purpura onycholysis pemphigus pemphigoid erythema multiforme toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome Neurologic and Psychiatric Anxiety amnesia convulsions depression hearing loss insomnia nervousness neuralgia neuropathy paresthesia somnolence tinnitus tremor vertigo and vision disturbances Miscellaneous As with other ACE inhibitors a symptom complex has been reported which may include a positive antinuclear antibody an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate arthralgia arthritis myalgia fever vasculitis eosinophilia photosensitivity rash and other dermatologic manifestations Additionally as with other ACE inhibitors eosinophilic pneumonitis has been reported Other Arthralgia arthritis dyspnea edema epistaxis impotence increased sweating malaise and weight gain Post marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials there have been rare reports of hypoglycemia reported during ramipril therapy when given to patients concomitantly taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin The causal relationship is unknown Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen Increases in creatinine levels occurred in of patients receiving ramipril alone and in of patients receiving ramipril and a diuretic Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in of patients receiving ramipril alone and in of patients receiving ramipril with a diuretic None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and based on experience with other ACE inhibitors would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis As ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion elevation of serum potassium can occur Use potassium supplements and potassium sparing diuretics with caution and monitor the patient s serum potassium frequently Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit a low value and a decrease of g dL or respectively were rare occurring in of patients receiving ramipril alone and in of patients receiving ramipril plus a diuretic No U S patients discontinued treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit Other Causal Relationships Unknown Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ramipril administration Elevations of liver enzymes serum bilirubin uric acid and blood glucose have been reported as have cases of hyponatremia and scattered incidents of leucopenia eosinophilia and proteinuria In U S trials less than of patients discontinued treatment for laboratory abnormalities all of these were cases of proteinuria or abnormal liver function tests Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important It allows continued monitoring of the benefit risk balance of the medicinal product If your patient experiences any side effects write to drugsafety cipla com You can also report side effects directly via the national pharmacovigilance program of India by calling on or you can report to Cipla Ltd on By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this product Overdose Single oral doses of ramipril in rats and mice of g kg g kg resulted in significant lethality In dogs oral doses as high as g kg induced only mild gastrointestinal distress Limited data on human overdosage are available The most likely clinical manifestations would be symptoms attributable to hypotension Laboratory determinations of serum levels of ramipril and its metabolites are not widely available and such determinations have in any event no established role in the management of ramipril overdose No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers e g maneuvers to change the pH of the urine that might accelerate elimination of ramipril and its metabolites Similarly it is not known which if any of these substances can be effectively removed from the body by hemodialysis Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist antidote in the setting of ramipril overdose but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities Because the hypotensive effect of ramipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia it is reasonable to treat ramipril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution Pharmacological Properties Mechanism of Action Ramipril and ramiprilat the active metabolite of ramipril inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme ACE in human subjects and animals ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with ramipril alone for up to weeks approximately of patients during the trial had abnormally high serum potassium and an increase from baseline more than mEq L and none of the patients had abnormally low potassium and a decrease from baseline more than mEq L In the same study approximately of patients treated with ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to weeks had abnormally high potassium values and an increase from baseline of mEq L or more and approximately had abnormally low values and decreases from baseline of mEq L or more Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity The effect of ramipril on hypertension appears to result at least in part from inhibition of both tissue and circulating ACE activity thereby reducing angiotensin II formation in tissue and plasma ACE is identical to kininase an enzyme that degrades bradykinin Whether increased levels of bradykinin a potent vasodepressor peptide play a role in the therapeutic effects of ramipril remains to be elucidated While the mechanism through which ramipril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system RAAS ramipril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low renin hypertension Although ramipril was antihypertensive in all races studied black hypertensive patients usually a low renin hypertensive population had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non Black patients Pharmacodynamic Properties Single doses of ramipril of mg produce approximately inhibition of ACE activity hours after dosing with approximately inhibition after hours Multiple oral doses of ramipril of mg or more cause plasma ACE activity to fall by more than hours after dosing with over inhibition of ACE activity remaining hours after dosing The more prolonged effect of even small multiple doses presumably reflects saturation of ACE binding sites by ramiprilat and relatively slow release from those sites Pharmacokinetic Properties Absorption Following oral administration of ramipril peak plasma concentrations of ramipril are reached within one hour The extent of absorption is at least and is not significantly influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract Distribution Cleavage of the ester group primarily in the liver converts ramipril to its active diacid metabolite ramiprilat Peak plasma concentrations of ramiprilat are reached hours after drug intake The serum protein binding of ramipril is about and that of ramiprilat about in vitro these percentages are independent of concentration over the range of to g ml Metabolism Ramipril is almost completely metabolized to ramiprilat which has about times the ACE inhibitory activity of ramipril and to the diketopiperazine ester the diketopiperazine acid and the glucuronides of ramipril and ramiprilat all of which are inactive After oral administration of ramipril about of the parent drug and its metabolites is eliminated in the urine and about is found in the feces Drug recovered in the feces may represent both biliary excretion of metabolites and or unabsorbed drug however the proportion of a dose eliminated by the bile has not been determined Less than of the administered dose is recovered in urine as unchanged ramipril Blood concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat increase with increased dose but are not strictly dose proportional The hour AUC for ramiprilat however is dose proportional over the mg dose range The absolute bioavailabilities of ramipril and ramiprilat were and respectively when mg of oral ramipril was compared with the same dose of ramipril given intravenously Plasma concentrations of ramiprilat decline in a triphasic manner initial rapid decline apparent elimination phase terminal elimination phase The initial rapid decline which represents distribution of the drug into a large peripheral compartment and subsequent binding to both plasma and tissue ACE has a half life of hours Because of its potent binding to ACE and slow dissociation from the enzyme ramiprilat shows two elimination phases The apparent elimination phase corresponds to the clearance of free ramiprilat and has a half life of hours The terminal elimination phase has a prolonged half life more than hours and probably represents the binding dissociation kinetics of the ramiprilat ACE complex It does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug After multiple daily doses of ramipril mg the half life of ramiprilat concentrations within the therapeutic range was hours After once daily dosing steady state plasma concentrations of ramiprilat are reached by the fourth dose Steady state concentrations of ramiprilat are somewhat higher than those seen after the first dose of ramipril especially at low doses mg but the difference is clinically insignificant In patients with creatinine clearance less than mL min m peak levels of ramiprilat are approximately doubled and trough levels may be as much as quintupled In multiple dose regimens the total exposure to ramiprilat AUC in these patients is times as large as it is in patients with normal renal function who receive similar doses In patients with impaired liver function the metabolism of ramipril to ramiprilat appears to be slowed possibly because of diminished activity of hepatic esterases and plasma ramipril levels in these patients are increased about fold Peak concentrations of ramiprilat in these patients however are not different from those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function and the effect of a given dose on plasma ACE activity does not vary with hepatic function Excretion The urinary excretion of ramipril ramiprilat and their metabolites is reduced in patients with impaired renal function Compared to normal subjects patients with creatinine clearance mL min m had higher peak and trough ramiprilat levels and slightly longer times to peak concentrations Other Special Populations Renal Impairment Renal excretion of ramiprilat is reduced in patients with impaired renal function and renal ramiprilat clearance is proportionally related to creatinine clearance This results in elevated plasma concentrations of ramiprilat which decrease more slowly than in subjects with normal renal function Hepatic Impairment In patients with impaired liver function the metabolism of ramipril to ramiprilat was delayed due to diminished activity of hepatic esterases and plasma ramipril levels in these patients were increased Peak concentrations of ramiprilat in these patients however are not different from those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetic profile of ramipril was studied in pediatric hypertensive patients aged years weighing kg After doses of to mg kg ramipril was rapidly and extensively metabolized to ramiprilat Peak plasma concentrations of ramiprilat occurred within hours Ramiprilat clearance highly correlated with the log of body weight p as well as dose p Clearance and volume of distribution increased with increasing children age for each dose group The dose of mg kg in children achieved exposure levels comparable to those in adults treated with ramipril mg The dose of mg kg in children resulted in exposure levels higher than the maximum recommended dose of mg per day in adults Non Clinical Properties Carcinogenesis Mutagenesis Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was found when ramipril was given by gavage to rats for up to months at doses of up to mg kg day or to mice for up to months at doses of up to mg kg day For either species these doses are about times the maximum recommended human dose when compared on the basis of body surface area No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria the micronucleus test in mice unscheduled DNA synthesis in a human cell line or a forward gene mutation assay in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line Several metabolites and degradation products of ramipril were also negative in the Ames test A study in rats with dosages as great as mg kg day did not produce adverse effects on fertility Description Ramipril is a aza bicyclo octane carboxylic acid derivative It is a white crystalline

from the blood and produce urine Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder These tubes are called the ureters The bladder stores urine until it s time to urinate Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra Kidney stones also called renal calculi nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys Diet excess body weight some medical conditions and certain supplements and medications are among the many causes of kidney stones Kidney stones can affect any part of your urinary tract from your kidneys to your bladder Often stones form when the urine becomes concentrated allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together Passing kidney stones can be quite painful but the stones usually cause no permanent damage if they re recognized in a timely fashion Depending on your situation you may need nothing more than to take pain medication and drink lots of water to pass a kidney stone In other instances for example if stones become lodged in the urinary tract are associated with a urinary infection or cause complications surgery may be needed Your doctor may recommend preventive treatment to reduce your risk of recurrent kidney stones if you re at increased risk of developing them again Products Services Book Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies Symptoms Kidney stones Enlarge image Close Kidney stones Kidney stones Kidney stones form in your kidneys As stones move into your ureters the thin tubes that allow urine to pass from your kidneys to your bladder signs and symptoms can result Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include severe pain nausea vomiting fever chills and blood in your urine A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm which can be very painful At that point you may experience these symptoms Severe sharp pain in the side and back below the ribs Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity Pain or burning sensation while urinating Other signs and symptoms may include Pink red or brown urine Cloudy or foul smelling urine A persistent need to urinate urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills if an infection is present Pain caused by a kidney stone may change for instance shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity as the stone moves through your urinary tract When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs and symptoms that worry you Seek immediate medical attention if you experience Pain so severe that you can t sit still or find a comfortable position Pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting Pain

form when your urine contains more crystal forming substances such as calcium oxalate and uric acid than the fluid in your urine can dilute At the same time your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form Types of kidney stones Knowing the type of kidney stone you have helps determine its cause and may give clues on how to reduce your risk of getting more kidney stones If possible try to save your kidney stone if you pass one so that you can bring it to your doctor for analysis Types of kidney stones include Calcium stones Most kidney stones are calcium stones usually in the form of calcium oxalate Oxalate is a substance made daily by your liver or absorbed from your diet Certain fruits and vegetables as well as nuts and chocolate have high oxalate content Dietary factors high doses of vitamin D intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions such as renal tubular acidosis It may also be associated with certain medications used to treat migraines or seizures such as topiramate Topamax Trokendi XR Qudexy XR Struvite stones Struvite stones form in response to a urinary tract infection These stones can grow quickly and become quite large sometimes with few symptoms or little warning Uric acid stones Uric acid stones can form in people who lose too much fluid because of chronic diarrhea or malabsorption those who eat a high protein diet and those with diabetes or metabolic syndrome Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones Cystine stones These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder called cystinuria that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of a specific amino acid Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing kidney stones include Family or personal history If someone in your family has had kidney stones you re more likely to develop stones too If you ve already had one or more kidney stones you re at increased risk of developing another Dehydration Not drinking enough water each day can increase your risk of kidney stones People who live in warm dry climates and those who sweat a lot may be at higher risk than others Certain diets Eating a diet that s high in protein sodium salt and sugar may increase your risk of some types of kidney stones This is especially true with a high sodium diet Too much salt in your diet increases the amount of calcium your kidneys must filter and significantly increases your risk of kidney stones Obesity High body mass index BMI large waist size and weight gain have been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones Digestive diseases and surgery Gastric bypass surgery inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea can cause changes in the digestive process that affect your absorption of calcium and water increasing the amounts of stone forming substances in your urine Other medical conditions such as renal tubular acidosis cystinuria hyperparathyroidism and repeated urinary tract infections also can increase your risk of kidney stones Certain supplements and medications such as vitamin C dietary supplements laxatives when used excessively calcium based antacids and certain medications used to treat migraines or depression can increase your risk of kidney stones By Mayo Clinic Staff Kidney stones care at Mayo Clinic Request an appointment Diagnosis

Male urinary system Male urinary system Your urinary system includes the kidneys ureters bladder and urethra The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper abdomen They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder These tubes are called the ureters The bladder stores urine until it s time to urinate Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra Female urinary system Enlarge image Close Female urinary system Female urinary system Your urinary system includes the kidneys ureters bladder and urethra The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper abdomen They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder These tubes are called the ureters The bladder stores urine until it s time to urinate Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra Bladder stones can develop when your bladder doesn t empty completely This causes urine to become concentrated urine Concentrated urine can crystallize and form stones Some infections can lead to bladder stones Sometimes an underlying condition that affects the bladder s ability to hold store or eliminate urine can result in bladder stone formation Any foreign materials present in the bladder tend to cause bladder stones The most common conditions that cause bladder stones include Prostate gland enlargement An enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH can cause bladder stones in men An enlarged prostate can obstruct the flow of urine preventing the bladder from emptying completely Damaged nerves Normally nerves carry messages from your brain to your bladder muscles directing your bladder muscles to tighten or release If these nerves are damaged from a stroke spinal cord injury or other health problem your bladder may not empty completely This is known as neurogenic bladder Other possible causes of bladder stones include Inflammation Bladder inflammation sometimes caused by urinary tract infections or radiation therapy to the pelvis can lead to bladder stones Medical devices Bladder catheters slender tubes inserted through the urethra to help urine drain from your bladder may cause bladder stones So can objects that accidentally migrate to your bladder such as a contraceptive device or urinary stent Mineral crystals which later become stones tend to form on the surfaces of these devices Kidney stones Stones that form in your kidneys are not the same as bladder stones They develop in different ways But small kidney stones may travel down the ureters into your bladder and if not expelled can grow into bladder stones Risk factors Men especially those over are more likely to have bladder stones Conditions that can raise the risk of bladder stones include An obstruction Any condition that blocks the flow of urine from your bladder to the urethra the tube that carries urine out of your body can lead to bladder stone formation There are a number of causes but the most common is an enlarged prostate Nerve damage Stroke spinal cord injuries Parkinson s disease diabetes a herniated disk and a number of other problems can damage nerves that control bladder function It s possible to have nerve damage and a condition that causes bladder outlet obstruction Having these together further increases the risk of stones Complications Bladder stones that don t pass even those that don t cause symptoms can lead to complications such as Chronic bladder problems Untreated bladder stones can cause long term urinary difficulties such as pain or frequent urination Bladder stones can also lodge in the opening where urine exits the bladder into the urethra and block the flow of urine Urinary tract infections Repeated bacterial infections in your urinary tract may be caused by bladder stones Prevention Bladder stones are usually caused by an underlying condition that s hard to prevent but you can decrease your chances of bladder stones by following these tips Tell your doctor about unusual urinary symptoms Early diagnosis and treatment of an enlarged prostate or another urologic condition may reduce your risk of developing bladder stones Drink plenty of fluids Drinking more fluids especially water may help prevent bladder stones because fluids dilute the concentration of minerals in your bladder How much water you should drink depends on your age size

of urine Tiny stones may cause no symptoms but larger stones can cause excruciating pain in the area between the ribs and hips in the back Usually an imaging test and an analysis of urine are done to diagnose stones Sometimes stone formation can be prevented by changing the diet or increasing fluid intake Stones that do not pass on their own are removed with lithotripsy Stone removal Stones

of shock waves to break up those stones or an endoscopic technique the use of specialized tools to view and operate on internal organs Urinary tract stones form in a kidney and may pass into a ureter or the bladder Depending on where a stone is located it may be called a kidney stone ureteral stone or bladder stone The process of stone formation is called urolithiasis renal lithiasis or nephrolithiasis The Urinary Tract Every year about of adults in the United States are hospitalized because of stones in the urinary tract Stones are more common among middle aged and older adults Stones vary in size from too small to be seen with the naked eye to inch centimeters or more in diameter A large so called staghorn because of its many projections that resemble a deer s antlers stone may fill almost the entire renal pelvis the central collecting chamber of the kidney and the tubes that drain into it calyces Inside the Kidney A urinary tract infection Overview of Urinary Tract Infections UTIs In healthy people urine in the bladder is sterile no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present The tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body urethra contains no bacteria read more may result when bacteria become trapped in urine that pools above a blockage When stones block the urinary tract for a long time urine backs up in the tubes inside the kidney causing excessive pressure that can cause the kidney to swell hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis A Distended Kidney and eventually damage it Types of stones Stones are made of minerals in the urine that form crystals Sometimes the crystals grow into stones About of the stones are composed of calcium and the remainder are composed of various substances including uric acid cystine or struvite Struvite stones a mixture of magnesium ammonium and phosphate are also called infection stones because they form only in infected urine Causes of Urinary Tract Stones Stones may form because the urine becomes too saturated with salts that can form stones or because the urine lacks the normal inhibitors of stone formation Citrate is such an inhibitor because it normally binds with calcium that is often involved in forming stones Kidney Stones Myths PODCAST Stones are more common among people with certain disorders for example hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism In hypercalcemia the level of calcium in blood is too high A high calcium level may result from a problem with the parathyroid glands as well as from diet cancer or disorders affecting read more dehydration Dehydration Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body Vomiting diarrhea excessive sweating burns kidney failure and use of diuretics may cause dehydration People feel thirsty and as dehydration read more and renal tubular acidosis Renal Tubular Acidosis RTA In renal tubular acidosis the kidney tubules malfunction resulting in excess levels of acid in the blood The tubules of the kidneys that remove acid from the blood are damaged when a person read more and among people whose diet is very high in animal source protein or vitamin C or who do not consume enough water or calcium People who have a family history of stone formation are more likely to have calcium stones and to have them more often People who have undergone surgery for weight loss bariatric surgery may also be at increased risk of stone formation Rarely medications including indinavir and substances in the diet such as melamine cause stones Symptoms of Urinary Tract Stones Stones especially tiny ones may not cause any symptoms Stones in the bladder may cause pain in the lower abdomen Stones that obstruct the ureter or renal pelvis or any of the kidney s drainage tubes may cause back pain or renal colic Renal colic is characterized by an excruciating intermittent pain usually in the area between the ribs and hip on one side that spreads across the abdomen and often extends to the genital area The pain tends to come in waves gradually increasing to a peak intensity then fading over about to minutes The pain may radiate down the abdomen toward the groin or testis or vulva Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting restlessness sweating and blood or a stone or a piece of a stone in the urine A person may have an urge to urinate frequently particularly as a stone passes down the ureter Chills fever burning or pain during urination cloudy foul smelling urine and abdominal swelling sometimes occur Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Stones Symptoms Computed tomography CT Doctors usually suspect stones in people with renal colic Sometimes doctors suspect stones in people with tenderness over the back and groin or pain in the genital area without an obvious cause Finding blood in the urine supports the diagnosis but not all stones cause blood in the urine Occasionally the symptoms and physical examination findings are so distinctive that no additional tests are needed particularly in people who have had urinary tract stones before However most people are in so much pain and have symptoms and findings that make other causes for the pain seem likely enough that testing is necessary to exclude these other causes Doctors need to differentiate stones from other possible causes of severe abdominal pain including Peritonitis which may be caused by appendicitis Appendicitis Appendicitis is inflammation and infection of the appendix Often a blockage inside the appendix causes the appendix to become inflamed and infected Abdominal pain nausea and fever are common read more ectopic

evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder See also Overview of the Urinary Tract X rays are usually not helpful in evaluating read more done without the use of radiopaque contrast material Radiographic Contrast Agents During imaging tests contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail Contrast agents include Radiopaque contrast agents read more is usually the best diagnostic procedure CT can locate a stone and also indicate the degree to which the stone is blocking the urinary tract CT can also detect many other disorders that can cause pain similar to the pain caused by stones The main disadvantage of CT is that it exposes people to radiation Still this risk seems prudent when possible causes include another serious disorder that would be diagnosed by CT such as an aortic aneurysm Aortic Branch Aneurysms Aortic branch aneurysms are bulges dilations in the wall of the major arteries that come directly off of the aorta See also Overview of Aortic Aneurysms and Aortic Dissection The aorta read more or appendicitis Appendicitis Appendicitis is inflammation and infection of the appendix Often a blockage inside the appendix causes the appendix to become inflamed and infected Abdominal pain nausea and fever are common read more Newer CT devices and methods that limit exposure to radiation are now commonly used Ultrasonography Ultrasonography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder See also Overview of the Urinary Tract X rays are usually not helpful in evaluating read more is an alternative to CT and does not expose people to radiation However ultrasonography compared with CT more often misses small stones especially when located in the ureter the exact location of urinary tract blockage and other serious disorders that could be causing the symptoms Did You Know People who have recurrent kidney stones should consider limiting the number of CT scans they get to prevent excessive radiation exposure X rays Plain x rays There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder See also Overview of the Urinary Tract X rays are usually not helpful in evaluating read more of the abdomen expose people to much less radiation than does CT but x rays are much less accurate in diagnosing stones and can show only calcium stones When doctors suspect the person has a calcium stone x rays are an alternative to confirm the presence of a stone or to see how far a stone has traveled down the ureter Excretory urography Intravenous urography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder See also Overview of the Urinary Tract X rays are usually not helpful in evaluating read more previously called intravenous urography or intravenous pyelography is a series of x rays taken after intravenous injection of a radiopaque contrast agent This test can detect stones and accurately determine the degree to which they are blocking the urinary tract but it is time consuming and involves the risks of exposure to the contrast agent for example an allergic reaction or worsening of kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood Kidney failure has many possible causes Some lead to a rapid decline in kidney function read more Doctors rarely use excretory urography to diagnose stones if CT or ultrasonography is available Urinalysis Urinalysis and Urine Culture Urinalysis the testing of urine may be necessary in the evaluation of kidney and urinary tract disorders and can also help evaluate bodywide disorders such as diabetes or liver problems A read more is usually done It may show blood or pus in the urine whether or not symptoms are present Determining stone type For people with diagnosed stones doctors often do tests to determine the type of stones People should attempt to retrieve stones that are passed They can retrieve stones by straining all urine through a paper or mesh filter Stones found can be analyzed Depending on the type of stone urine and blood tests may be necessary to measure levels of calcium uric acid hormones and other substances that may increase the risk of stone formation Treatment of Urinary Tract Stones Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs or opioids as needed to relieve pain Sometimes stone removal Small stones that are not causing symptoms blockage of the urinary tract Urinary Tract Obstruction Urinary tract obstruction is a blockage that inhibits the flow of urine through its normal path the urinary tract including the kidneys ureters bladder and urethra Blockage can be complete read more or an infection usually do not need to be treated and often pass on their own Larger stones over three sixteenths of an inch mm and those that are closer to the kidney are less likely to pass on their own Pain relief The pain of renal colic may be relieved with NSAIDs If the pain is severe opioids are sometimes needed Stone passing strategies Drinking plenty of fluids or receiving large amounts of fluids intravenously has been recommended to help stones pass but it is not clear that this approach is helpful Alpha adrenergic blockers such as tamsulosin may help the stone pass Once a stone has passed no other immediate treatment is needed Stone bypass procedures Sometimes when a blockage is severe doctors insert a temporary tube stent in the ureter to bypass the obstructing stone Doctors insert a telescopic viewing instrument cystoscope a kind of endoscope into the bladder and pass the stent through the cystoscope and into the opening of the ureter The stent is pushed up past the obstructing stone The stent is left in place until the stone can be removed for example by surgery Alternatively doctors may drain the blockage by inserting a drainage tube through the back into the kidney nephrostomy tube Stone removal Often shock wave lithotripsy can be used to break up a stone in the renal pelvis or uppermost part of the ureter that is inch centimeter or less in diameter In this procedure shock waves directed at the body by a sound wave generator break up the stone The pieces of stone are then passed in the urine Removing a Stone With Sound Waves Kidney stones can sometimes be broken up by sound waves produced by a lithotriptor in a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy SWL After an ultrasound device or fluoroscope is used to locate the stone the lithotriptor is placed against the back and the sound waves are focused on the stone shattering it Then the person drinks fluids to flush the stone fragments out of the kidney to be eliminated in the urine Sometimes blood appears in the urine or the abdomen is bruised after the procedure but serious problems are rare A ureteroscope a small viewing telescope a kind of endoscope can be inserted into the urethra through the bladder and up the ureter to remove small stones in the lower part of the ureter that require removal In some instances the ureteroscope can also be used with a device to break up stones into smaller pieces that can be removed with the ureteroscope or passed in the urine a procedure called intracorporeal lithotripsy Most commonly holmium laser lithotripsy is used In this procedure a laser is used to break up the stone Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be used to remove some larger kidney stones In percutaneous nephrolithotomy doctors make a small incision in the person s back and then insert a telescopic viewing tube called a nephroscope a kind of endoscope into the kidney Doctors insert a probe through the nephroscope to break the stone into smaller pieces and then remove the pieces nephrolithotripsy Making the urine more alkaline for example with potassium citrate taken for to months by mouth may sometimes gradually dissolve uric acid stones Other types of stones cannot be dissolved this way Surgical removal is sometimes needed for larger stones that are causing an obstruction Endoscopic surgery is usually used to remove struvite stones Antibiotics are not helpful in treating urinary tract infections Urinary Tract Infections UTIs until the infection stones are completely removed Ureteral stenting is the placement of a soft hollow tube to help urine drain from the kidney to the bladder A ureteral stent may be necessary for a week or two after a procedure done to remove a stone Irritation from the stone or from the removal procedure could cause some inflammation of the ureter The stent helps the inflammation resolve Prevention of Urinary Tract Stones In a person who has passed a calcium stone for the first time the likelihood of forming another stone is about within year within years and within years Measures to prevent the formation of new stones vary depending on the composition of the existing stones Drinking large amounts of fluids to ten ounce milliliter glasses a day is recommended for prevention of all stones People should drink enough fluid to produce more than about quarts of urine per day Other preventive measures depend somewhat on the type of stone Calcium stones People with calcium stones may have a condition called hypercalciuria in which excess calcium is excreted in the urine For these people measures that decrease the amount of calcium in the urine can help prevent formation of new stones One such measure is a diet that is low in sodium and high in potassium Calcium Overview of Calcium s Role in the Body Calcium is one of the body s electrolytes which are minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in body fluids such as blood but most of the body s calcium is uncharged See also read more intake should be about normal to milligrams daily about to servings of dairy per day The risk of a new stone forming is actually higher if the diet contains too little calcium so people should not try to eliminate calcium from their diet However people may need to avoid sources of excess calcium such as antacids that contain calcium Thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or indapamide also reduce the concentration of calcium in the urine in such people Potassium citrate may be given to increase a low urine level of citrate a substance that inhibits calcium stone formation Restricting dietary animal protein may help reduce urinary calcium and the risk of stone formation in many people with calcium stones Did You Know People who have calcium stones are more likely to develop other stones if their diet has too little or too much calcium A high level of oxalate in the urine which contributes to calcium stone formation may result from excess consumption of foods high in oxalate such as rhubarb spinach cocoa nuts pepper and tea or from certain intestinal disorders including some kinds of weight loss surgery Calcium citrate cholestyramine and a diet that is low in fat and in oxalate containing food may help to reduce urinary oxalate levels in some people Pyridoxine vitamin B decreases the amount of oxalate the body makes In rare cases when calcium stones result from hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism In hypercalcemia the level of calcium in blood is too high A high calcium level may result from a problem with the parathyroid glands as well as from diet cancer or disorders affecting read more sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a disease in which abnormal collections of inflammatory cells granulomas form in many organs of the body Sarcoidosis usually develops in people aged to years most often read more vitamin D toxicity Vitamin D Excess Taking very high doses of vitamin D supplements can cause vitamin D toxicity Vitamin D toxicity causes high levels of calcium in the blood People with vitamin D toxicity may lose their appetite read more renal tubular acidosis Renal Tubular Acidosis RTA In renal tubular acidosis the kidney tubules malfunction resulting in excess levels of acid in the blood The tubules of the kidneys that remove acid from the blood are damaged when a person read more or cancer the underlying disorder must be treated Uric acid stones Uric acid stones are almost always caused by excessive acid levels in the urine Potassium citrate should be given to all people who have uric acid stones to make the urine alkaline and neutralize the high acid levels that cause uric acid stones Occasionally a low animal protein diet or allopurinol may be used to reduce uric acid levels in the urine Maintaining a large fluid intake is also very important Cystine stones For stones made of cystine urinary cystine levels must be kept low by maintaining a large fluid intake and sometimes taking alpha mercaptopropionylglycine tiopronin or penicillamine Struvite stones People with recurrent struvite stones may need to take antibiotics continually to prevent urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections UTIs In healthy people urine in the bladder is sterile no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present The tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body urethra contains no bacteria read more Acetohydroxamic acid may also be helpful in people with struvite stones Drugs Mentioned

Frequently Asked Questions Related Resources Advertisement Advertisement What are Kidney Stones Urine contains many dissolved minerals and salts When your urine has high levels of these minerals and salts you can form stones Kidney stones can start small but can grow larger in size even filling the inner hollow structures of the kidney Some stones stay in the kidney and do not cause any problems Sometimes the kidney stone can travel down the ureter the tube between the kidney and the bladder If the stone reaches the bladder it can be passed out of the body in urine If the stone becomes lodged in the ureter it blocks the urine flow from that kidney and causes pain The Kidneys and Urinary System The kidneys are fist size organs that handle the body s fluid and chemical levels Most people have two kidneys one on each side of the spine behind the liver stomach pancreas and intestines Healthy kidneys clean waste from the blood and remove it in the urine They control the levels of sodium potassium and calcium in the blood Diagram of the Female Urinary Tract Enlarge The kidneys ureters and bladder are part of your urinary tract The urinary tract makes transports and stores urine in the body The kidneys make urine from water and your body s waste The urine then travels down the ureters into the bladder where it is stored Urine leaves your body through the urethra Kidney stones form in the kidney Some stones move from the kidney into the ureter The ureters are tubes leading from the kidneys to the bladder If a stone leaves the kidney and gets stuck in the ureter it is called a ureteral stone Diagram of the Male Urinary Tract Enlarge What are Kidney Stones Made of Kidney stones come in many different types and colors How you treat them and stop new stones from forming depends on what type of stone you have Diagram of Kidney Stones Enlarge Calcium stones percent of stones Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone There are two types of calcium stones calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate Calcium oxalate is by far the most common type of calcium stone Some people have too much calcium in their urine raising their risk of calcium stones Even with normal amounts of calcium in the urine calcium stones may form for other reasons Uric acid stones percent of stones Uric acid is a waste product that comes from chemical changes in the body Uric acid crystals do not dissolve well in acidic urine and instead will form a uric acid stone Having acidic urine may come from Being overweight Chronic diarrhea Type diabetes high blood sugar Gout A diet that is high in animal protein and low in fruits and vegetables Struvite infection stones percent of stones Struvite stones are not a common type of stone These stones are related to chronic urinary tract infections UTIs Some bacteria make the urine less acidic and more basic or alkaline Magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite stones form in alkaline urine These stones are often large with branches and they often grow very fast People who get chronic UTIs such as those with long term tubes in their kidneys or bladders or people with poor bladder emptying due to neurologic disorders paralysis multiple sclerosis and spina bifida are at the highest risk for developing these stones Cystine stones less than percent of stones Cystine is an amino acid that is in certain foods it is one of the building blocks of protein Cystinuria too much cystine in the urine is a rare inherited metabolic disorder It is when the kidneys do not reabsorb cystine from the urine When high amounts of cystine are in the urine it causes stones to form Cystine stones often start to form in childhood Symptoms Common symptoms of kidney stones include a sharp cramping pain in the back and side This feeling often moves to the lower abdomen or groin The pain often starts suddenly and comes in waves It can come and go as the body tries to get rid of the stone other signs of a kidney stone include A feeling of intense need to urinate Urinating more often or a burning feeling during urination Urine that is dark or red due to blood Sometimes urine has only small amounts of red blood cells that can t be seen with the naked eye Nausea and vomiting For men you may feel pain at the tip of the penis Causes Low Urine Volume A major risk factor for kidney stones is constant low urine volume Low urine volume may come from dehydration loss of body fluids from hard exercise working or living in a hot place or not drinking enough fluids When urine volume is low urine is concentrated and dark in color Concentrated urine means there is less fluid to keep salts dissolved Increasing fluid intake will dilute the salts in your urine By doing this you may reduce your risk of stones forming Adults who form stones should drink enough fluid to make at least liters gallon of urine every day On average this will take about liters ounces of fluid intake per day While water is likely the best fluid to drink what matters most is getting enough fluid Diet Diet can also affect the chance of forming a stone One of the more common causes of calcium kidney stones is high levels of calcium in the urine High urine calcium levels may be due to the way your body handles calcium It is not always due to how much calcium you eat Lowering the amount of calcium in your diet rarely stops stones from forming Studies have shown that restricting dietary calcium can be bad for bone health and may increase kidney stone risk Health care providers usually do not tell people to limit dietary calcium in order to lower urine calcium But calcium intake should not be too high Instead of lowering dietary calcium intake your health care provider may try to reduce your urine calcium level by decreasing your sodium salt intake Too much salt in the diet is a risk factor for calcium stones This is because too much salt is passing into the urine keeping calcium from being reabsorbed from the urine and into the blood Reducing salt in the diet lowers urine calcium making it less likely for calcium stones to form Because oxalate is a component of the most common type of kidney stone calcium oxalate eating foods rich in oxalate can raise your risk of forming these stones A diet high in animal protein such as beef fish chicken and pork can raise the acid levels in the body and in the urine High acid levels make it easier for calcium oxalate and uric acid stones to form The breakdown of meat into uric acid also raises the chance that both calcium and uric acid stones will form Bowel Conditions Certain bowel conditions that cause diarrhea such as Crohn s Disease or ulcerative colitis or surgeries such as gastric bypass surgery can raise the risk of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones Diarrhea may result in loss of large amounts of fluid from the body lowering urine volume Your body may also absorb excessive oxalate from the intestine resulting in more oxalate in your urine Both low urine volume and high levels of urine oxalate can help to cause calcium oxalate kidney stone formation Obesity Obesity is a risk factor for stones Obesity may change the acid levels in the urine leading to stone formation Medical conditions Some medical conditions have an increased risk of kidney stones Abnormal growth of one or more of the parathyroid glands which control calcium metabolism can cause high calcium levels in the blood and urine This can lead to kidney stones Another condition called distal renal tubular acidosis in which there is acid build up in the body can raise the risk of calcium phosphate kidney stones Some rare inherited disorders can also make certain types of stones more likely Examples include cystinuria which is too much of the amino acid cystine in the urine and primary hyperoxaluria in which the liver makes too much oxalate Medication Some medications and calcium and vitamin C supplements may increase your risk of forming stones Be sure to tell your health care provider all the medications and supplements you take as these could affect your risk of stone formation Do not stop taking any of these unless your health care provider tells you to do so Family History The chance of having kidney stones is much higher if you have a family history of stones such as a parent or sibling Diagnosis Silent kidney stones those that cause no symptoms are often found when an X ray is taken during a health exam Other people have their stones diagnosed when sudden pain occurs while the stone is passing and medical attention is needed When a person has blood in the urine hematuria or sudden abdominal or side pain tests like an ultrasound or a CT scan may diagnose a stone These imaging tests tell the health care provider how big the stone is and where it is located A CT scan is often used in the ER when a stone is suspected It is used because it can make a quick and exact diagnosis Treatment Treatment depends on the type of stone how bad it is and the length of time you have had symptoms There are different treatments to choose from It is important to talk to your health care provider about what is best for you Wait for the stone to pass by itself Often you can simply wait for the stone to pass Smaller stones are more likely than larger stones to pass on their own Waiting up to four to six weeks for the stone to pass is safe as long as the pain is bearable there are no signs of infection the kidney is not completely blocked and the stone is small enough that it is likely to pass While waiting for the stone to pass you should drink normal amounts of water You may need pain medication when there is discomfort Medication Certain medications have been shown to improve the chance that a stone will pass The most common medication prescribed for this reason is tamsulosin Tamsulosin Flomax relaxes the ureter making it easier for the stone to pass You may also need pain and anti nausea medicine as you wait to pass the stone Surgery Surgery may be needed to remove a stone from the ureter or kidney if The stone fails to pass The pain is too great to wait for the stone to pass The stone is affecting kidney function Small stones in the kidney may be left alone if they are not causing pain or infection Some people choose to have their small stones removed They do this because they are afraid the stone will unexpectedly start to pass and cause pain Kidney stones should be removed by surgery if they cause repeated infections in the urine or because they are blocking the flow of urine from the kidney Today surgery usually involves small or no incisions cuts minor pain and minimal time off work Surgeries to remove stones in the kidneys or ureters are Shock wave lithotripsy SWL Shock Wave Lithotripsy SWL is used to treat stones in the kidney and ureter Shock waves are focused on the stone using X rays or ultrasound to pinpoint the stone Repeated firing of shock waves on the stone usually causes the stone to break into small pieces These smaller pieces of stones pass out in the urine over a few weeks Diagram of Kidney Stones ESWL Enlarge Because of possible discomfort caused by the shock waves and the need to control breathing during the procedure some form of anesthesia is often needed SWL does not work well on hard stones such as cystine some types of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones or very large stones With SWL you may go home the same day as the procedure You may be able to resume normal activities in two to three days You may also be given a strainer to collect the stone pieces as they pass These pieces will be sent to the laboratory to be tested Although SWL is widely used and considered very safe it can still cause side effects You may have blood in your urine for a few days after treatment Most stone pieces pass painlessly Larger pieces may get stuck in the ureter causing pain and needing other removal procedures Ureteroscopy URS Ureteroscopy URS is used to treat stones in the kidney and ureter URS involves passing a very small telescope called an ureteroscope into the bladder up the ureter and into the kidney Rigid telescopes are used for stones in the lower part of the ureter near the bladder Flexible telescopes are used to treat stones in the upper ureter and kidney Diagram of Kidney Stones Ureteroscopy Enlarge The ureteroscope lets the urologist see the stone without making an incision cuts General anesthesia keeps you comfortable during the URS procedure Once the urologist sees the stone with the ureteroscope a small basket like device grabs smaller stones and removes them If a stone is too large to remove in one piece it can be broken into smaller pieces with a laser or other stone breaking tools Once the stone has been removed whole or in pieces the health care provider may place a temporary stent in the ureter A stent is a tiny rigid plastic tube that helps hold the ureter open so that urine can drain from the kidney into the bladder Unlike a catheter or PCNL drain tube this tube is completely within the body and does not require an external bag to collect urine You may go home the same day as the URS and can begin normal activities in two to three days If your urologist places a stent he or she will remove it four to days later Sometimes a string is left on the end of the stent so you can remove it on your own It is very important that the stent is removed when your health care provider tells you Leaving the stent in for long periods can cause an infection and loss of kidney function Percutaneous nephrolithotomy PCNL Percutaneous Lithotripsy PCNL is the best treatment for large stones in the kidney General anesthesia is needed to do a PCNL PCNL involves making a half inch incision cut in the back or side just large enough to allow a rigid telescope nephroscope to be passed into the hollow center part of the kidney where the stone is located Diagram of PCNL Enlarge An instrument passed through the nephroscope breaks up the stone and suctions out the pieces The ability to suction pieces makes PCNL the best treatment choice for large stones After the PCNL a tube is usually left in the kidney to drain urine into a bag outside of the body This will allow for drainage of urine and stop any bleeding The tube is left in overnight or for a few days You may have to stay in the hospital overnight after this operation Your urologist may choose to do X rays while you are still in the hospital to see if any stone pieces remain If there are any your urologist may want to look back into the kidney with a telescope again to remove them You can begin normal activities after about one to two weeks Other surgery Other kidney surgery is rarely used to remove stones Open laparoscopic or robotic surgery may be used only if all other less invasive procedures fail Why You Get Stones Part of preventing stones is finding out why you get them Your health care provider will perform tests to find out what is causing this After finding out why you get stones your health care provider will give you tips to help stop them from coming back Some of the tests he or she may do are listed below Medical and Dietary History Your health care provider will ask questions about your personal and family medical history He or she may ask if Have you had more than one stone before Has anyone in your family had stones Do you have a medical condition that may increase your chance of having stones like frequent diarrhea gout or diabetes Knowing your eating habits is also helpful You may be eating foods that are known to raise the risk of stones You may also be eating too few foods that protect against stones or not drinking enough fluids Understanding your medical family and dietary history helps your health care provider find out how likely you are to form more stones Blood and Urine Tests After taking a complete history and doing a physical exam your health care provider may take blood and urine samples for testing Blood tests can help find if a medical problem is causing your stones Your urine can be tested to see if you have a urinary tract infection or crystals that are typical of different stone types If you are at high risk for getting stones in the future a hour urine collection can be done This test will reveal the levels of different stone forming substances in your urine The results of this test can help your health care provider recommend make specific diet and medications to prevent future stones Imaging Tests When a health care provider sees you for the first time and you have had stones before he or she may want to see recent X rays or order a new X ray They will do this to see if there are any stones in your urinary tract Imaging tests may be repeated over time to check for stone growth You may also need this test if you are having pain hematuria blood in your urine or recurrent infections Stone Analysis If you pass a stone or a stone is removed by surgery your health care provider will want to test it Testing the stone will determine what type of stone it is This information helps your health care provider decide the best way to prevent future stones Prevention of Future Stones Once your health care provider finds out why you are forming stones he or she will give you tips on how to prevent them This may include changing your diet and taking certain medications There is no one size fits all diet for preventing kidney stones Everyone is different Your diet may not be causing your stones to form But there are dietary changes that you can make to stop stones from continuing to form Diet Changes Drink enough fluids each day If you are not producing enough urine your health care provider will recommend you drink at least liters of liquid each day This equals about quarts about ten ounce glasses This is a great way to lower your risk of forming new stones Remember to drink more to replace fluids lost when you sweat from exercise or in hot weather All fluids count toward your fluid intake But it s best to drink mostly no calorie or low calorie drinks This may mean limiting sugar sweetened or alcoholic drinks Knowing how much you drink during the day can help you understand how much you need to drink to produce liters of urine Use a household measuring cup to measure how much liquid you drink for a day or two Drink from bottles or cans with the fluid ounces listed on the label Keep a log and add up the ounces at the end of the day or hour period Use this total to be sure you are reaching your daily target urine amount of at least ounces liters of urine daily Health care providers recommend people who form cystine stones drink more liquid than other stone formers Usually liters of liquid is advised to reduce cystine levels in your urine Reduce the amount of salt in your diet This tip is for people with high sodium intake and high urine calcium or cystine Sodium can cause both urine calcium and cystine to be too high Your health care provider may advise you to avoid foods that have a lot of salt The Centers for Disease Control CDC and other health groups advise not eating more than mg of salt per day The following foods are high in salt and should be eaten in moderation Cheese all types Most frozen foods and meats including salty cured meats deli meats cold cuts hot dogs bratwurst and sausages Canned soups and vegetables Breads bagels rolls and baked goods Salty snacks like chips and pretzels Bottled salad dressings and certain breakfast cereals Pickles and olives Casseroles other mixed foods pizza and lasagna Canned and bottled sauces Certain condiments table salt and some spice blends Eat the recommended amount of calcium If you take calcium supplements make sure you aren t getting too much calcium On the other hand make sure you aren t getting too little calcium either Talk with your health care provider or dietitian about whether you need supplements Good sources of calcium to choose from often are those low in salt Eating calcium rich foods or beverages with meals every day is a good habit There are many non dairy sources of calcium such as calcium fortified non dairy milks There are good choices especially if you avoid dairy You can usually get enough calcium from your diet without supplements if you eat three to four servings of calcium rich food Many foods and beverages have calcium in them Some foods and beverages that might be easy to include on a daily basis with meals are Table of Foods Rich in Calcium Enlarge Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables Eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily is recommended for all people who form kidney stones Eating fruits and vegetables give you potassium fiber magnesium antioxidants phytate and citrate all of which may help keep stones from forming A serving means one piece of fruit or one potato or one cup of raw vegetables For cooked vegetables a serving is cup If you are worried you may not be eating the right amount of fruits and vegetables talk to your health care provider about what will be best for you Eat foods with low oxalate levels This recommendation is for patients with high urine oxalate Eating calcium rich foods see table above with meals can often control the oxalate level in your urine Urinary oxalate is controlled because eating calcium lowers the oxalate level in your body But if doing that does not control your urine oxalate you may be asked to eat less of certain high oxalate foods Nearly all plant foods have oxalate but a few foods contain a lot of it These include spinach rhubarb and almonds It is usually not necessary to completely stop eating foods that contain oxalate This needs to be determined individually and depends on why your oxalate levels are high in the first place Eat less meat If you make cystine or calcium oxalate stones and your urine uric acid is high your health care provider may tell you to eat less animal protein If your health care provider thinks your diet is increasing your risk for stones he or she will tell you to eat less meat fish seafood poultry pork lamb mutton and game meat than you eat now This might mean eating these foods once or twice rather than two or three times a day fewer times during the week or eating smaller portions when you do eat them The amount to limit depends on how much you eat now and how much your diet is affecting your uric acid levels Medications Changing your diet and increasing fluids may not be enough to prevent stones from forming Your health care provider may give you medications to take to help with this The type of stone and the urine abnormalities you have will help your health care provider decide if you need medicine and which medicine is best Common medications include Thiazide diuretics are for patients who have calcium stones and high levels of calcium in their urine Thiazides lower urine calcium by helping the kidney take calcium out of the urine and put it back in the blood stream When taking thiazides you need to limit how much salt you take in as these medications work best when urine sodium is low Potassium citrate is for patients with calcium stones and low urinary citrate and for those with uric acid and cystine stones Potassium citrate makes the urine less acidic or more alkaline basic This helps prevent cystine and uric acid stones It also raises the citrate level in the urine helping to prevent calcium stones Allopurinol is frequently prescribed for gout which is caused by high uric acid in the blood Allopurinol not only lowers the level of uric acid in the blood but also in the urine so it may also be prescribed to help prevent calcium and uric acid stones Acetohydroxamic acid AHA is for patients who produce struvite or infection stones These stones form because of repeated urinary tract infections UTI AHA makes the urine unfavorable for struvite stones to form The best way to prevent stuvite stones is to prevent repeated UTIs caused by specific types of bacteria and to completely remove the stones with surgery Cystine binding thiol drugs are used only for patients who form cystine stones These medications d penicillamine or tiopronin bind to cystine in the urine and form a compound that is less likely than cystine to crystallize in the urine This drug is used when other measures fail such as raising fluid intake reducing salt intake or using potassium citrate Vitamin supplements should be used carefully as some can increase your risk of forming kidney stones Your health care provider and a dietitian may be good sources of information about over the counter nutritional supplements Frequently Asked Questions What is a staghorn stone Like the horns of a stag deer these stones get their name from the shape they take as they grow to fill the inside of the kidney Staghorn stones often form because of repeated urinary tract infections UTIs with certain kinds of bacteria Even though they can grow to a large size you may have no idea you have them because they cause little or no pain A staghorn stone can lead to poor kidney function even without blocking the passage of urine Most often staghorn shaped stones are the struvite infection type of stone Will my children get kidney stones because I have them Kidney stones are more common in people who have a family member with kidney stones Some conditions that cause stones may be inherited But sometimes kidney stones form in relatives because of similar diet and lifestyle Can kidney stones damage my kidneys Yes but rarely Kidney stones can cause damage if they cause repeated or serious infection or cause kidney blockage for a long time Some stones if left untreated can cause the kidney to stop working Why is it important that I follow up with my health care provider about my kidney stones During treatment your health care provider may ask you to do another hour urine collection and have your blood work checked to see if your urine test results have improved Your health care provider will also check to see if you are having any side effects from your medications If you form stones often you will need monitoring with X rays and urine studies to be sure no new stones are forming Your health care provider will monitor you to make sure your medications and diet changes are working How do I manage my kidney stone along with my other health problems such as diabetes and or a heart disorder Diet changes recommended for heart conditions also often help prevent stones A healthy diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and less animal protein and salt can help avoid stones and other conditions You can learn more from your health care provider or dietician Keeping a normal weight can also help avoid diabetes and stones My stone has not passed Do I need surgery If a stone in the ureter does not pass in a reasonable time or is causing pain or infection you will need surgery to remove it What happens if I keep developing stones You may get another stone even if you ve had surgery changed your diet or are taking medications However with the right dietary and medical treatment you can be less likely to get stones over and over again Related Resources Preventing Kidney Stones Ureteral Stents What You Need to Know What You Need to Know about Kidney Stones Kidney stones are on the rise

Diagnosing kidney stones Treating kidney stones Preventing kidney stones About kidney stones Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged to They re quite common with around three in men and up to two in women developing them at some stage of their lives The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis and if they cause severe pain it s known as renal colic Symptoms of kidney stones Small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine But it s fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system such as the ureter the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder urethra the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body A blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection UTI Read more about the symptoms of kidney stones What causes kidney stones The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys Over time the crystals may build up to form a hard stone like lump This is more likely to happen if you don t drink enough fluids if you re taking some types of medication or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine Read more about the causes of kidney stones After a kidney stone has formed your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet in the urine This means it will often travel through the urinary system the kidneys kidney tubes and bladder Treating and preventing kidney stones Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your urine and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy Occasionally keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly Read more about treating kidney stones It s estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following five years To avoid getting kidney stones make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you don t become dehydrated It s very important to keep your urine diluted clear to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones Read more about preventing kidney stones Symptoms of kidney stones Very small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate Symptoms usually occur if the kidney stone gets stuck in your kidney starts to travel down the ureter the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can cause pain as they try to pass through causes an infection In these cases the symptoms of kidney stones can include a persistent ache in the lower back which is sometimes also felt in the groin men may have pain in their testicles and scrotum periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen or occasionally in your groin which may last for minutes or hours feeling restless and unable to lie still nausea feeling sick needing to urinate more often than normal pain when you urinate dysuria blood in your urine haematuria this may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter Blocked ureter and kidney infection A kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage which may cause a build up of bacteria The symptoms of a kidney infection are similar to symptoms of kidney stones but may also include a high temperature fever of C F or over chills and shivering feeling very weak or tired diarrhoea cloudy and bad smelling urine Read more about kidney infections Causes of kidney stones Kidney stones are usually formed following a build up of certain chemicals in the body This build up may be any of the following calcium ammonia uric acid a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy cysteine an amino acid that helps to build protein Certain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine You re also more likely to develop kidney stones if you don t drink enough fluids Recurrent kidney stones Some people are particularly likely to keep on developing kidney stones including people who eat a high protein low fibre diet are inactive or bed bound have a family history of kidney stones have had several kidney or urinary infections have had a kidney stone before particularly if it was before you were have only one fully working kidney have had an intestinal bypass surgery on your digestive system or a condition affecting the small intestine such as Crohn s disease Medication There s evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones These include aspirin antacids diuretics used to reduce fluid build up certain antibiotics certain antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV certain anti epileptic medication Types of kidney stones Kidney stones can develop for a number of reasons The causes of the four main types of kidney stone are outlined below Calcium stones Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there s too much calcium in the urine which can be due to an inherited condition called hypercalcuria which leads to large amounts of calcium in urine an overactive parathyroid gland the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body kidney disease a rare condition called sarcoidosis some cancers Calcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough Struvite stones Struvite stones are often caused by infections and they most commonly occur after a urinary tract infection that s lasted a long time Struvite stones are more common in women than men Uric acid stones Uric acid stones can form if there s a large amount of acid in your urine They may be caused by eating a high protein diet that includes lots of meat a condition such as gout that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals an inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body chemotherapy Cystine stones Cystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone They re caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine Diagnosing kidney stones Your GP will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history It will be particularly easy if you ve had kidney stones before You may be given tests including urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine blood tests to check that your kidneys are working properly and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones such as calcium You can collect a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking Having a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier and may help your GP determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you If you have severe pain that isn t controlled by painkillers or if you have a high temperature as well as pain you may be referred to a urologist a specialist in treating urinary problems Imaging tests If you re referred to hospital for an imaging test a number of different techniques may be used Imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis or identify precisely where a kidney stone is These tests include a computerised tomography CT scan where a series of X rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together X ray an imaging technique that uses high energy radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue an ultrasound scan uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body an intravenous urogram IVU or intravenous pyelogram IVP a dye that shows up on X ray is injected into a vein in your arm the X ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your urine CT scans are now often used because they re thought to be more accurate IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method The imaging technique you have may depend on what s available at your local hospital Treating kidney stones Most kidney stones are small enough less than mm in diameter to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home But even small kidney stones can be painful although this usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed Medication If you are in severe pain your GP can give you pain relief by injection A second dose can be given after half an hour if you re still experiencing pain Medication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea feeling sick and vomiting This is called an anti emetic anti sickness medication You may also be given a prescription for painkillers anti emetics or both to take at home Self care You may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet and to try to collect it from your urine You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking Give the stone to your GP so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need You should drink enough water to make your urine colourless If your urine is yellow or brown you re not drinking enough Admission to hospital If your kidney stone has moved into your ureter the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder and it s causing severe pain your GP may admit you to hospital for treatment This may be necessary if you re at an increased risk of your kidneys failing for example because you only have one kidney your symptoms don t improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti sickness medication you re dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down you re pregnant you re over years of age Treating large kidney stones If a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally mm about to in in diameter or larger you may need treatment to remove it another way This could include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ESWL ureteroscopy percutaneous nephrolithotomy PCNL open surgery These procedures are explained in more detail below The type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ESWL ESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can t be passed in the urine It involves using ultrasound high frequency sound waves to pinpoint where a kidney stone is Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces so it can be passed in your urine ESWL can be an uncomfortable form of treatment so it s usually carried out after giving painkilling medication You may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones ESWL is up to effective for stones up to mm in in diameter Ureteroscopy If a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter you may need to have a ureteroscopy which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery RIRS It involves passing a long thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body and into your bladder It s then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck The surgeon may either try to gently remove the stone using another instrument or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine Ureteroscopy is carried out under general anaesthetic where you re unconscious so you shouldn t drive or operate machinery for up to hours after the procedure For stones up to mm in a ureteroscopy is effective in of cases A plastic tube called a stent may need to be temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder Percutaneous nephrolithotomy PCNL PCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones It may also be used if ESWL isn t suitable for example because the person being treated is obese PCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy PCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic so you shouldn t drive or operate machinery for up to hours after the procedure PCNL is effective for stones that are mm in in diameter Open surgery Nowadays open surgery for kidney stones is rare less than of cases require this type of surgery It s only usually used if there s a very large stone or abnormal anatomy During open surgery an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney The kidney stone can then be removed Treating uric acid stones If you have a uric acid stone you may be advised to drink around three litres just over five pints of water each day to try to dissolve it Uric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone and they can be made smaller if they re exposed to alkaline fluids You may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve Complications of treatment Complications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones Your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure Possible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones Complications could include sepsis an infection that spreads through the blood causing symptoms throughout the whole body a blocked ureter caused by stone fragments the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder an injury to the ureter a urinary tract infection bleeding during surgery pain It s estimated that of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy Preventing kidney stones The best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated Keeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones You can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour The darker your urine is the more concentrated it is Your urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build up of waste products that your body has produced overnight Drinks such as tea coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing You should also make sure you drink more when it s hot or when you re exercising to replenish fluids lost through sweating Read more about preventing dehydration Diet If your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet Oxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone Foods that contain oxalates include beetroot asparagus rhubarb chocolate berries leeks parsley celery almonds peanuts and cashew nuts soy products grains such as oatmeal wheat germ and wholewheat Don t reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your GP advises you to This is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth To avoid developing a uric acid stone you should reduce the amount of meat poultry and fish in your diet You may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine Medication If you have a kidney stone medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing However some medication may need to be reviewed by your GP if it s thought to be causing your kidney stone The type of medication your GP prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have For example if you have calcium stones you may be prescribed a diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria an inherited condition struvite stones you may be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent a urinary tract infection or kidney infection which are the main causes of struvite stones uric acid stones you may be prescribed allopurinol a medication used to lower uric acid levels and medication to help alkalise your urine cystine stones you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in your urine Source NHS Opens in new browser window Last updated March Home Illnesses and

lithiasis Share A kidney stone is a solid mass made up of tiny crystals One or more stones can be in the kidney or ureter at the same time If you ever have severe pain in your belly or one side of your back that comes and goes suddenly you may be passing a kidney stone Let s talk about the painful condition of kidney stones A kidney stone is a mass of tiny crystals in your kidney or urinary tract Stones are quite common and tend to run in families They can form in weeks or months when your urine contains too much of certain substances There are several kinds of kidney stones Calcium stones are by far the most common kind They often form in men between the ages of to Calcium can combine with other substances found in your food like oxalate phosphate or carbonate to form stones Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria a condition passed down through families in which stones are made from an amino acid called cystine Struvite stones are found mostly in women who have urinary tract infections These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney ureter or bladder Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women They can occur in people who have a history of gout or are going through chemotherapy So how do you know if you have kidney stones Well you may not have symptoms until the stone move down the ureter tubes through which urine empties into your bladder When this happens the stones can block the flow of urine out of your kidneys The main symptom is severe sharp pain that starts suddenly usually in your belly or one side of your back and it may go away just as quickly Other symptoms can include abnormal urine color blood in your urine fever chills nausea and vomiting So what do you do about kidney stones Well your health care provider will perform a physical exam You may need blood tests kidney function tests and tests that look for crystals in your urine Several imaging tests like a CT scan can see stones or a blockage in your urinary tract Treatment will depend on the type of stone you have and how bad your symptoms are Small kidney stones that are less than mm in diameter will usually pass on their own You should drink at least to glasses of water per day to produce a large enough amount of urine to help bring the stone out Pain can be pretty bad when you pass a kidney stone so your doctor may prescribe pain medicines to help as well as medications that will help the stone pass Other medicines can decrease stone formation or help break down and remove the material that is causing you to make stones You may need surgery if the stone is too large to pass the stone is growing or the stone is blocking your urine flow Kidney stones are painful but you can usually pass them without causing permanent harm However kidney stones often come back so you and your doctor will need to work on finding the cause of your stone Lastly delaying treatment can lead to serious complications so if you think that you have kidney stones see your doctor right away The kidneys are responsible for removing wastes from the body regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure and the stimulation of red blood cell production This is the typical appearance of the blood vessels vasculature and urine flow pattern in the kidney The blood vessels are shown in red and the urine flow pattern in yellow Before we talk about how kidney stones are formed take a moment to become familiar with the urinary tract The urinary tract includes the kidneys ureters bladder and urethra Now let s enlarge a kidney to get a closer view Here s a cross section of the kidney Urine flows from the outer cortex to the inner medulla The renal pelvis is the funnel through which urine exits the kidney and enters the ureter As urine passes through the kidneys it can become very concentrated When the urine becomes too concentrated calcium uric acid salts and other chemicals dissolved in the urine can crystallize forming a kidney stone or renal calculus Usually the calculus is the size of a small pebble But ureters are very sensitive to being stretched and when stones form and distend it the stretching can be very painful Often people may not know they have kidney stones until they feel the painful symptoms resulting from a stone being stuck anywhere along the urinary tract Fortunately small stones typically pass out of the kidneys and through the ureters on their own without causing any problems However stones can become more problematic when they block the flow of urine Doctors call this one a staghorn kidney stone and it is obstructing the entire kidney Fortunately these stones are the exception rather than the rule Kidney stones result when urine becomes too concentrated and substances in the urine crystalize to form stones Symptoms arise when the stones begin to move down the ureter causing intense pain Kidney stones may form in the pelvis or calyces of the kidney or in the ureter Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ESWL is a procedure used to shatter simple stones in the kidney or upper urinary tract Ultrasonic waves are passed through the body until they strike the dense stones Pulses of sonic waves pulverize the stones which are then more easily passed through the ureter and out of the body in the urine Cystinuria is a disorder characterized by cystine stones in the kidney ureter and bladder A genetic abnormality results in abnormal transport of amino acids in the kidney The high levels of the amino acid cystine in the urine lead to stone formation While this disease only accounts for to of urinary tract stones in the general population it is the most common cause among children A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney Kidney stones may be the size of sand or gravel as large as a pearl or even larger A stone can block the flow of urine and cause great pain If you ever have severe pain in your belly or one side of your back that comes and goes suddenly you may be passing a kidney stone Let s talk about the painful condition of kidney stones A kidney stone is a mass of tiny crystals in your kidney or urinary tract Stones

stones often come back so you and your doctor will need to work on finding the cause of your stone Lastly delaying treatment can lead to serious complications so if you think that you have kidney stones see your doctor right away Causes Kidney stones are common Some types run in families They often occur in premature infants There are different types of kidney stones The cause of the problem depends on the type of stone Stones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances that form crystals These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months Calcium stones are most common They are most likely to occur in men between ages to Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone Oxalate is the most common of these Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach It is also found in vitamin C supplements Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones Calcium stones can also form from combining with phosphate or carbonate Other types of stones include Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria This disorder runs in families It affects both men and women Struvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated urinary tract infections These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney ureter or bladder Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women They can occur with gout or chemotherapy Other substances such as certain medicines also can form stones The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than liter ounces of urine a day Symptoms You may not have symptoms until the stones move down the tubes ureters through which urine empties into your bladder When this happens the stones can block the flow of urine out of the kidneys The main symptom is severe pain that starts and stops suddenly Pain may be felt in the belly area or side of the back Pain may move to the groin area groin pain testicles testicle pain in men and labia vaginal pain in women Other symptoms can include Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine Chills Fever Nausea and vomiting Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam The belly area abdomen or back might feel sore Tests that may be done include Blood tests to check calcium phosphorus uric acid and electrolyte levels Kidney function tests Urinalysis to see crystals and look for red blood cells in urine Examination of the stone to determine the type Stones or a blockage can be seen on Abdominal CT scan Abdominal x rays Kidney ultrasound Retrograde pyelogram Treatment Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested Drink at least to glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine This will help the stone pass Pain can be very bad Over the counter pain medicines for example ibuprofen and naproxen either alone or along with narcotics can be very effective Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital You may need to get fluids through an IV into your vein For some types of stones your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone These medicines can include Allopurinol for uric acid stones Antibiotics for struvite stones Diuretics water pills Phosphate solutions Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate Water pills thiazide diuretics Tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass Surgery is often needed if The stone is too large to pass on its own The stone is growing The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage The pain cannot be controlled Today most treatments are much less invasive than in the past Lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than one half an inch centimeters that are located in the kidney or ureter It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones into tiny fragments Then the stone fragments leave the body in the urine It is also called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or ESWL Procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin on your back and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed The stone is removed with a tube endoscope Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract A laser is used to break up the stone Rarely open surgery nephrolithotomy may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible Talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you You will need to take self care steps Which steps you take depend on the type of stone you have but they may include Drinking extra water and other liquids Eating more of some foods and cutting back on other foods Taking medicines to help prevent stones Taking medicines to help you pass a stone anti inflammatory drugs alpha blockers Outlook Prognosis Kidney stones are painful but most of the time can be removed from the body without causing lasting damage Kidney stones often come back This occurs more often if the cause is not found and treated You are at risk for Urinary tract infection Kidney damage or scarring if treatment is delayed for too long Possible Complications Complication of kidney stones may include the obstruction of the ureter acute unilateral obstructive uropathy When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of a kidney stone Severe pain in your back or side that will not go away Blood in your urine Fever and chills Vomiting Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy A burning feeling when you urinate If you have been diagnosed with blockage from a stone passage must be confirmed either by capture in a strainer during urination or by follow up x ray Being pain free does not confirm that the stone has passed Prevention If you have a history of stones Drink plenty of fluids to glasses of water per day to produce enough urine You may need to take medicine or make changes to your diet for some types of stones Your provider may want to do blood and urine tests to help determine the proper prevention steps
