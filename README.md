Detection of Sorted URLs from Keywords on Text of Medicine wrapper/box/strip using OCR and rake_nltk.
This model utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and keyword extraction techniques to extract relevant information from images of medicine wrappers, boxes, and strips. The model uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from the images and applies the RAKE algorithm from the NLTK library to identify keywords. Subsequently, it uses the Google-Search-API to search for URLs related to the extracted keywords.
-	"ImageToKeyWords.ipynb" uses ‘InputImages’ a dataset containing images of medicine wrappers, boxes, or strips to extract text from these images. It then extracts keywords from this text to generate the output file "TextKeyWords.xlsx."
-	File 'KeyWord-to-Web.ipynb' on Google Colab uses 'TextKeyWords.xlsx' to find URLs related to these keywords for each image in 'ImageLinks.txt' and the body text on each URL in 'ImageLinksText.txt.' It then calculates Rouge Scores between keywords and URL body text for each image in the file 'ResultOfMedicineTextRough.xlsx.'
